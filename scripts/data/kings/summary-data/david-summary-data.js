        heading: "Early Life and Anointing",
        text: "David was the youngest son of Jesse, from the tribe of Judah, born in Bethlehem. He grew up as a shepherd boy, taking care of his father’s sheep, learning to play the harp, and writing many Psalms. He also demonstrated courage, killing a lion and a bear that threatened his flock. When King Saul disobeyed God, the prophet Samuel was sent to anoint the next king. God chose David, the youngest son, and Samuel anointed him as king, even while Saul still reigned. The Spirit of the Lord came powerfully upon David."

        text: "Saul was troubled by an evil spirit, and David was brought to play the harp, calming the king. David became one of Saul’s attendants. When Israel faced the giant Goliath, David’s faith and courage led him to defeat the Philistine with only a sling and five stones, gaining fame and causing Saul’s jealousy. David became close friends with Jonathan, Saul’s son, who protected him from his father’s anger."

        text: "As Saul’s jealousy grew, David fled for his life, hiding in caves, forests, and deserts. Despite chances to kill Saul, David refused to harm the Lord’s anointed. Many men joined him, forming David’s mighty men. He demonstrated leadership and trust in God throughout these hardships."

        heading: "King of Israel and Jerusalem",
        text: "After Saul’s death, David mourned him and Jonathan. The people of Judah made David king at Hebron for seven and a half years, and later all Israel accepted him, making him king over the entire nation for a total of forty years. David captured Jerusalem from the Jebusites, making it the capital and bringing the Ark of the Covenant there with great joy. God blessed David with victories over his enemies and loyalty from his people. He showed kindness to Mephibosheth, Jonathan’s lame son."

        text: "David committed adultery with Bathsheba and had her husband Uriah killed to cover it. The prophet Nathan confronted him, leading David to repent deeply and write Psalm 51. Though God forgave him, the consequences remained. Later, Bathsheba gave birth to Solomon, whom God loved."

        heading: "Final Years and Legacy",
        text: "Near the end of his reign, David sinned by taking a census, showing pride. God allowed a plague, which ended when David repented and built an altar on Araunah’s threshing floor, later the site of Solomon’s Temple. David prepared everything for the temple and appointed Solomon as king. He died peacefully after forty years of reign and was buried in the City of David. David’s life, a mix of faith and failure, earned him the title 'a man after God’s own heart.' His songs and prayers in the Psalms continue to inspire millions."
