        text: "Rehoboam was the son of King Solomon and Naamah, an Ammonite woman. He became the fourth king of Israel after his father Solomon died. His story is found in 1 Kings 12–14 and 2 Chronicles 10–12. Rehoboam started his reign with great promise, but because of his pride and unwise decisions, the kingdom that his grandfather David and his father Solomon had built was divided into two parts during his rule."

        text: "When Solomon died, Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had gathered to make him king. The people of Israel sent for Jeroboam, who had once been one of Solomon’s officials but had fled to Egypt after a prophecy said he would rule over ten tribes. Jeroboam returned and came before Rehoboam with all the people. They said, 'Your father put a heavy burden on us with his hard labor and heavy taxes. Make the work lighter, and we will serve you.'"

        heading: "The Division of the Kingdom",
        text: "Rehoboam asked for three days to think about it. He first consulted the elders who had served his father Solomon. They advised him kindly, saying, 'If you serve the people today, speak good words to them, and ease their burden, they will be your loyal servants forever.' But Rehoboam did not like their advice. He turned instead to the young men who had grown up with him. They told him, 'Tell the people, “My little finger is thicker than my father’s waist. My father laid heavy burdens on you; I will make them even heavier. My father punished you with whips; I will punish you with scorpions.”' When Jeroboam and the people came back, Rehoboam answered harshly. The ten northern tribes rebelled and refused to follow him. Only Judah and Benjamin remained loyal."

        text: "Rehoboam became king over the southern kingdom, called Judah, with Jerusalem as its capital. Jeroboam became king over the northern kingdom, called Israel, with Samaria later becoming its capital. The great division lasted for generations — a result of Rehoboam’s pride and unwillingness to listen."

        text: "After the kingdom split, Rehoboam gathered an army of 180,000 soldiers from Judah and Benjamin to fight against the northern tribes. But God sent a message through Shemaiah the prophet, saying, 'Do not fight against your brothers, the Israelites. This thing is from Me.' Rehoboam wisely obeyed and stopped the war."

        text: "Rehoboam then strengthened his rule over Judah. He built and fortified cities like Bethlehem, Hebron, and Lachish to protect his kingdom. Many priests and Levites moved to Judah from the northern kingdom. For the first three years, he and the people walked in the ways of the Lord. During these years, he married many women, had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and fathered twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters, appointing Abijah as his chief prince."

        text: "God allowed Shishak, king of Egypt, to attack Jerusalem in Rehoboam’s fifth year. Shishak came with a massive army and captured many fortified cities. The prophet Shemaiah warned Rehoboam, saying, 'You have abandoned Me; therefore I now abandon you to Shishak.' Rehoboam and the leaders humbled themselves, and God had mercy. Shishak took treasures from the temple and palace, and Rehoboam replaced the gold shields with bronze ones."

        text: "Although Rehoboam repented for a time, his heart was never fully devoted to God. He reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city chosen by the Lord. During his reign, tensions and wars with Israel continued. When he died, he was buried in the City of David, and his son Abijah became king."
