On the first day, he shouted the message that God had given him: “In forty days, Nineveh will be destroyed!” The people of Nineveh heard Jonah’s message and believed God. They became very sorry for their sins and decided to change their ways. To show their sorrow, they fasted—they stopped eating—and everyone, from the greatest to the least, put on rough cloth called sackcloth, which was a sign of repentance and sadness."

Then the king made an announcement to the whole city. He said, “This is the command from the king and his nobles: No one—people or animals, herds or flocks—is to eat or drink anything. Everyone must wear sackcloth, and everyone must cry out to God with all their strength. Let everyone turn away from their evil behavior and from the violence in their hands. Who knows? Maybe God will change His mind, have mercy on us, and not destroy us.”"

He prayed to the Lord and said, “Lord, didn’t I say this would happen when I was still at home? That’s why I tried to run away to Tarshish! I knew that You are a gracious and compassionate God, slow to get angry, full of love, and quick to forgive. You don’t like to bring punishment. Now, Lord, just take my life away. It is better for me to die than to live.”"
