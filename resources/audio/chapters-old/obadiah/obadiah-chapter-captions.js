            text: "The book of Obadiah is the shortest book in the Old Testament, and it contains just one chapter. It is a message from God to the people of Edom, given through the prophet Obadiah. Edom was a nation descended from Esau, the brother of Jacob (Israel). This prophecy shows God’s anger toward Edom for being proud and cruel toward their relatives, the Israelites."

        {
            text: "Obadiah begins with a vision from the Lord. God says He has sent a message to the nations, calling them to rise up and fight against Edom. God declares that He will make Edom small among the nations and greatly despised. The people of Edom had become proud because they lived in the rocky mountains, where they felt safe and untouchable. They said to themselves, “Who can bring us down?” But God says, “Even if you soar high like an eagle or build your nest among the stars, I will bring you down.”"
        },
        {
            text: "God explains that Edom will be completely destroyed. Unlike robbers or grape pickers, who always leave something behind, Edom’s enemies will take everything. They will search out and steal all their treasures. The friends and allies of Edom will turn against them and betray them. Their wise men and warriors will be destroyed, and no one will be able to help them."
        },
        {
            text: "Then God tells the reason for this judgment. Edom had treated Israel, their own relatives, with cruelty. When strangers attacked Jerusalem and carried off the wealth of the city, Edom stood by and watched instead of helping. Worse, they rejoiced at Israel’s suffering, spoke proudly about it, and even took part in the looting. They blocked the roads to stop the Israelites from escaping and handed survivors over to their enemies."
        },
        {
            text: "Because of these sins, God declares that “the day of the Lord” is near for all nations. Just as Edom had done to others, the same would be done to them. Their violence would come back on their own heads. But God promises that Mount Zion—a symbol of Jerusalem and God’s people—will be restored. Those who belong to the Lord will escape and be holy again."
        },
        {
            text: "The house of Jacob (Israel) and the house of Joseph (the northern tribes) will become strong like fire, while the house of Esau (Edom) will become like straw that burns up. There will be no survivors left from Edom, for the Lord Himself has spoken this judgment."
        },
        {
            text: "The chapter ends with a vision of hope: God’s people will return and take back their land. Those from the south will possess the mountains of Esau, and those from the plains will take the land of the Philistines and other surrounding regions. In the end, deliverers will go up to Mount Zion to rule over the mountains of Esau, and the kingdom will belong to the Lord."
        },
        {
            text: "This short but powerful book shows that God sees injustice and pride and will punish those who harm others—but He will also restore and protect His faithful people."
