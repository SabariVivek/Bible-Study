        text: "Jeroboam was the first king of the northern kingdom of Israel after the great division that took place under Rehoboam. He ruled over the ten northern tribes of Israel, while Rehoboam, the son of Solomon, ruled over Judah and Benjamin in the south. Jeroboam’s story is found mainly in 1 Kings 11–14 and 2 Chronicles 10–13. His reign began with great opportunity and promise, but he is remembered sadly as the king who led Israel away from God into idol worship."

        text: "Jeroboam was the son of Nebat, from the tribe of Ephraim, and his mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow. In his early life, Jeroboam worked as an official under King Solomon, overseeing the labor force of the tribes of Joseph (Ephraim and Manasseh). When the prophet Ahijah met him, he tore his cloak into twelve pieces, telling Jeroboam he would rule ten tribes because Solomon and his people had turned from God. Fearing this, Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, so he fled to Egypt until Solomon died."

        text: "After Solomon’s death, Jeroboam returned from Egypt. When Rehoboam refused to ease the people’s burdens, the ten northern tribes rebelled and made Jeroboam their king, fulfilling God’s prophecy. Jeroboam now ruled the northern kingdom, Israel, while Rehoboam ruled Judah in the south. He had a great opportunity to lead faithfully, but fear and doubt clouded his heart."

        heading: "Idolatry and Sin",
        text: "Jeroboam feared that people would return to Jerusalem for worship, so he built two golden calves at Bethel and Dan, encouraged idol worship, appointed non-Levite priests, and created a rival festival to Judah’s. His actions caused Israel to sin, and almost all subsequent kings of Israel followed his example."

        heading: "Warning from God",
        text: "A man of God from Judah prophesied that Jeroboam’s altar would be destroyed and his hand would wither. Even after his hand was miraculously restored, Jeroboam continued in idolatry. God later sent Ahijah the prophet to warn Jeroboam that his house would be destroyed and his child would die. When Jeroboam’s wife returned home, the child died as predicted."

        text: "Jeroboam’s reign continued with wars against Rehoboam and later Abijah, Rehoboam’s son. Despite clear warnings, Jeroboam never repented. He ruled for twenty-two years, and his son Nadab succeeded him. His name is remembered as an example of disobedience and idol worship, influencing generations of kings to come."

        heading: "Lessons from Jeroboam’s Life",
        text: "Jeroboam’s story teaches that even great opportunities and promises from God require complete trust and obedience. Fear, pride, and compromise can destroy a kingdom and calling. Jeroboam could have been a second David, but his idolatry made him a warning for all generations."
