            text: "This chapter begins with an introduction to the writer, who calls himself “the Teacher” (or “the Preacher”), the son of David and king in Jerusalem. Many believe this refers to King Solomon. The Teacher begins his reflections by saying a famous line: “Everything is meaningless!” or “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.” He means that, when we look at life only from an earthly point of view, everything seems empty and without lasting purpose."
        },
        {
            text: "He asks, “What does a person really gain from all the hard work they do under the sun?” In other words, people work so much, but what do they really keep forever?"
        },
        {
            text: "The Teacher then looks at nature and human life to show how everything just goes in circles and never truly changes. Generations come and go, but the earth stays the same. The sun rises and sets, only to rise again. The wind blows south, then north, turning in its endless patterns. Rivers flow into the sea, but the sea never becomes full; the water just returns to where it came from, and the cycle starts again."
        },
        {
            text: "He observes that people are never fully satisfied. “All things are wearisome,” he says. No matter how much we see, we are never content; no matter how much we hear, it is never enough. Everything feels repetitive—nothing new seems to happen. People may say, “Look, this is something new!” but the Teacher reminds them that it has already existed in some form before. Even the things that happened long ago are soon forgotten, and future generations will also be forgotten."
        },
        {
            text: "Then the Teacher speaks about his own search for meaning. He says he decided to use his wisdom to study and explore everything that happens under heaven. But he found that all human effort is like “chasing the wind”—busy, tiring, and impossible to grasp. He realized that the world is full of troubles that people cannot fix. “What is crooked cannot be made straight,” he says, meaning that many things in life are beyond our control."
        },
        {
            text: "He also says that he became wiser than anyone who ruled in Jerusalem before him, yet even great wisdom brought him sadness. The more he learned about life, the more he understood how unfair and confusing it is. He concludes, “For with much wisdom comes much sorrow; the more knowledge, the more grief.”"
        },
        {
            text: "So, Ecclesiastes chapter 1 sets the tone for the whole book: it shows how life can seem meaningless and frustrating when seen only through human understanding—but it also begins to point toward a deeper search for true purpose beyond what the world offers."

        },
        {
            text: "He begins by saying, “I said to myself, ‘Come now, I will test you with pleasure to find out what is good.’” But he soon realizes that even pleasure is meaningless. He laughs at laughter itself, saying it accomplishes nothing. He tries to cheer himself with wine and to experience the foolishness of pleasure while still using his wisdom to guide him. He wants to see what is worthwhile for people to do during their short life on earth."
        },
        {
            text: "Then he undertakes great projects. He builds houses, vineyards, gardens, and parks filled with trees and fruit. He builds pools to water the gardens. He buys slaves, owns large herds and flocks, gathers silver and gold, and collects treasures of kings and provinces. He brings in singers and delights of every kind. He says he became greater than anyone who had ever lived in Jerusalem before him, and his wisdom stayed with him the whole time."
        },
        {
            text: "He didn’t deny himself any pleasure—whatever his eyes desired, he took. He found joy in all his work, but in the end, he realized that even this was meaningless. He says, “When I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all meaningless—like chasing the wind. Nothing was gained under the sun.”"
        },
        {
            text: "Next, the Teacher compares wisdom and foolishness. He admits that wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness, because a wise person can see where they are going. Yet he also realizes that the same fate comes to both the wise and the foolish—they both die. So he asks, “What is the point of being so wise if we both end the same way?” He concludes again that this too is meaningless. After death, people soon forget who was wise or foolish, and all their efforts are left behind."
        },
        {
            text: "This thought makes him deeply discouraged. He begins to hate life, because all his work seemed useless and empty. He also hates all his labor, because everything he built will one day be left to someone else who didn’t work for it. Who knows whether that person will be wise or foolish? Yet he will control everything that the Teacher worked hard for under the sun. “This too is meaningless,” he says."
        },
        {
            text: "The Teacher becomes restless and full of sorrow. His days are full of pain and his mind never rests, even at night. Work itself, he says, brings no lasting peace."

            text: "Finally, he concludes that the best thing a person can do is to enjoy simple blessings—to eat, drink, and find satisfaction in their work. He realizes that even these small joys are gifts from God. Without God, no one can truly enjoy life or find meaning. To those who please Him, God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness. But to those who sin, God gives the task of gathering and storing up wealth only to hand it over to those who please Him."

            text: "Then he asks, “What do people really gain from all their hard work?” He says that God has given people the task of living and trying to understand life, but no one can completely grasp God’s work from beginning to end. God has made everything beautiful in its own time, and He has placed a sense of eternity in human hearts—meaning we all long for something beyond this world—but we still cannot fully understand His ways."

        {
            text: "So he concludes that people should enjoy their work while they can, because that is their portion in life. No one can truly know what will happen after them, so the wise thing is to value the present and receive it as a gift from God."

            text: "He begins by looking at oppression. He sees that there are many people being mistreated and suffering under the power of others. They cry out for help, but no one comforts them. The ones in power are cruel, and the weak have no support. This sight makes the Teacher very sad. He even says that it would be better to be dead than alive—and better still to never have been born—because then one would not have to see all the evil that happens under the sun."
        },
        {
            text: "Next, the Teacher looks at human jealousy and hard work. He notices that much of people’s labor and success comes from wanting to outdo others. This endless competition makes people unhappy. He calls it “chasing after the wind.” He then contrasts two attitudes:\n\nThe fool folds his hands and does nothing, which leads to ruin.\n\nThe worker never stops striving and competing, which also brings no peace."
        },
        {
            text: "So he concludes that it is better to have only a handful with peace and rest than to have both hands full with hard work and endless stress."
        },
        {
            text: "Then the Teacher observes another problem: loneliness. He describes a person who works hard, gains wealth, and has no family or friend to share it with. He keeps asking, “Who am I working for? Why am I depriving myself of joy?” This, too, is meaningless—a miserable way to live."
        },
        {
            text: "To teach the value of companionship, the Teacher says:\n\n“Two are better than one,” because they can help each other succeed.\n\nIf one falls, the other can lift them up, but if someone falls alone, there is no one to help.\n\nTwo people can keep each other warm, but how can one stay warm alone?\n\nIf someone is attacked, two can stand together and defend themselves.\nHe concludes with a proverb: “A cord of three strands is not easily broken.” This means that unity and close relationships make people stronger."
        },
        {
            text: "Finally, the Teacher talks about the emptiness of fame and power. He describes a poor but wise young man who rises to replace an old foolish king who no longer listens to advice. The young man becomes famous and powerful, and everyone celebrates him. But later, people lose interest in him too. The Teacher observes that even fame and popularity do not last—people forget the ones who came before them."

        {
            text: "In Ecclesiastes chapter 4, the Teacher helps us see that power without compassion, work without rest, and success without love all lead to emptiness—but relationships, humility, and contentment bring true value to life."

        },
        {
            text: "He begins by saying, “Be careful when you go to the house of God.” In other words, when you come before God, come to listen, not just to talk. It is better to be quiet and pay attention than to speak foolishly. He warns against making careless or empty promises to God. God is in heaven and we are on earth, so we should speak with few words and much respect."
        },
        {
            text: "The Teacher says that dreams come when there is much activity, and foolish talk comes when there are too many words. So, when you make a vow or promise to God, keep it quickly. It is better not to make a promise at all than to make one and fail to keep it. He reminds people that God does not take broken promises lightly—so do not let your mouth lead you into sin. Instead, fear God and take Him seriously."
        },
        {
            text: "Then the Teacher turns to the subject of wealth and oppression. He says that when you see injustice—poor people being mistreated or officials taking advantage of others—don’t be shocked. Every level of authority watches over another, and corruption often spreads upward through the system. Still, he notes that even a king benefits from the land’s produce, meaning that in the end, all people depend on the same basic things for survival."

            text: "Next, he talks about the love of money. He warns that those who love money will never have enough of it. No matter how much wealth a person gains, it never brings lasting satisfaction. This too, he says, is meaningless. The more riches people have, the more others come to consume them—servants, workers, or dependents—and the owner gains nothing but the sight of their possessions disappearing."

        {
            text: "The Teacher also calls it a sad tragedy when someone hoards wealth to their own harm, or when riches are lost through bad investments so that there’s nothing left for their children. He reminds everyone that we come into the world with nothing, and we leave with nothing. A person works hard for wind—meaning for things that don’t last. Life, he says, is full of struggle, darkness, and frustration when wealth becomes the center of attention."

            text: "Yet, the Teacher also recognizes that there is a right attitude toward wealth. He says that it is a good thing when a person can eat, drink, and enjoy the results of their work. These simple pleasures are a gift from God. The ability to enjoy life, to accept one’s place, and to find joy in one’s labor comes from Him."

A person may have everything they could ever want: wealth, possessions, and honor, so that they lack nothing their heart desires. Yet, if God does not allow them to enjoy it, and a stranger ends up enjoying those blessings instead, it is meaningless and deeply painful."

            text: "The Teacher says that even if a man has a hundred children and lives for many years, but does not enjoy his life or even receive a proper burial, then it would have been better for him not to have been born at all. He uses a strong image to describe this—he says a stillborn child (a baby born dead) is better off than such a person. The baby never sees the sun or knows pain, but at least it finds rest, while the rich man who never finds joy only continues in emptiness."
