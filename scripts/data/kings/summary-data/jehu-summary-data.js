        heading: "King Jehu – The Zealous King Who Destroyed Ahab’s Family but Failed to Follow God Fully",
        text: "King Jehu was one of the most energetic and violent kings of Israel. His story is full of judgment, action, and zeal, but also warning, because even though he carried out God’s command with great passion, he did not obey God completely. His story is found mainly in 2 Kings chapters 9 and 10, and it marks a major turning point in the history of the northern kingdom of Israel."

        heading: "Jehu’s Anointing",
        text: "Before becoming king, Jehu was a commander in the army of Israel. He served under King Joram (also called Jehoram), the son of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. During this time, Israel was at war with Syria (Aram), and King Joram was wounded in battle. He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his injuries.\n\nMeanwhile, in the southern kingdom of Judah, King Ahaziah, who was Joram’s nephew (because his mother was Ahab’s daughter Athaliah), came to Jezreel to visit Joram. So both kings — Joram of Israel and Ahaziah of Judah — were in Jezreel at the same time.\n\nNow, years earlier, during the time of the prophet Elijah, God had pronounced terrible judgment on the house of Ahab because of the evil he and Jezebel had done — the murder of Naboth, the worship of Baal, and the leading of Israel into sin. God said that every male in Ahab’s family would be destroyed and that dogs would eat Jezebel. The time for that prophecy to be fulfilled had finally come.\n\nAfter Elijah was taken up to heaven, the prophet Elisha continued God’s work. One day, Elisha sent one of his servants, a young prophet, to Ramoth-Gilead, where Jehu was with the army. The young prophet went secretly to Jehu, took him aside into a room, and anointed him with oil, saying: “Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: I anoint you king over the Lord’s people Israel. You are to strike down the house of Ahab your master, so that I may avenge the blood of My servants the prophets and the blood of all the Lord’s servants shed by Jezebel. The whole house of Ahab will perish, and I will cut off every male from Ahab’s family.”\n\nAfter saying this, the young prophet quickly opened the door and ran away, as Elisha had instructed."

        text: "When Jehu came back out, his fellow officers asked him what that young man had said. At first, Jehu tried to make light of it, but when they pressed him, he told them, “He said that the Lord has anointed me king over Israel.” Immediately, his fellow officers took off their cloaks, laid them on the steps under Jehu, blew a trumpet, and shouted, “Jehu is king!”\n\nWith this, Jehu became the new king — not by election or inheritance, but by divine appointment. He knew that his task was to destroy the wicked house of Ahab."

        heading: "Jehu Executes Judgment on Joram and Ahaziah",
        text: "Jehu then set out on his mission of judgment. He rode his chariot furiously toward Jezreel, where King Joram was resting. The watchman on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu’s company coming and reported it to the king. King Joram sent a messenger to ask, “Do you come in peace?” But Jehu did not answer peacefully — he said, “What have you to do with peace? Fall in behind me!”\n\nWhen the watchman saw that the messenger did not return, he sent a second one — but he also joined Jehu. Then the watchman said to Joram, “The driving is like the driving of Jehu son of Nimshi, for he drives furiously.”\n\nKing Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah both went out in their chariots to meet Jehu. They met him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite — the very field Ahab had taken after killing Naboth years earlier. There, Joram asked Jehu, “Have you come in peace, Jehu?”\n\nJehu answered, “How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother Jezebel abound?”\n\nJoram immediately turned his chariot around to flee, crying out, “Treachery, Ahaziah!” But Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram in the back. The arrow pierced his heart, and Joram fell dead in his chariot. Jehu commanded his officer Bidkar, “Throw him onto the field of Naboth, for remember how you and I rode together behind Ahab his father when the Lord said, ‘I will repay him here.’” This fulfilled Elijah’s prophecy exactly.\n\nKing Ahaziah of Judah tried to escape, but Jehu pursued him and wounded him near Ibleam. Ahaziah fled to Megiddo, where he died from his wounds. His servants carried his body to Jerusalem and buried him there."

        text: "Next, Jehu went to Jezreel, where Queen Jezebel was. When Jezebel heard that Jehu had come, she tried to face him proudly. She painted her eyes, fixed her hair, and looked out from a window, saying, “Have you come in peace, you murderer of your master?”\n\nJehu looked up and shouted, “Who is on my side? Who?” Two or three eunuchs looked down at him. Jehu said, “Throw her down!” They obeyed and threw Jezebel out of the window. She fell to the ground, and her blood splattered on the wall and the horses. Jehu then trampled her with his horses.\n\nAfterward, Jehu went inside to eat and drink. Later, he told his men, “Go and bury this cursed woman, for she is a king’s daughter.” But when they went to bury her, they found only her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands. The dogs had eaten the rest of her body, exactly as Elijah had prophesied."

        heading: "Destruction of Ahab’s Family",
        text: "After Jezebel’s death, Jehu wrote letters to the officials and guardians in Samaria, where seventy sons of Ahab lived. In the letters, he challenged them to choose one of Ahab’s sons and set him on the throne to fight for their master’s house. The officials, terrified, replied that they would serve Jehu and not make any move against him.\n\nThen Jehu sent another letter telling them to bring the heads of Ahab’s sons to him at Jezreel the next day. They obeyed out of fear — they killed all seventy sons and put their heads in baskets, which they sent to Jehu. Jehu ordered the heads to be piled at the city gate as a public display, saying, “Know then that not a word the Lord has spoken against the house of Ahab shall fail.”\n\nJehu then went further. He killed everyone who remained of Ahab’s family in Jezreel, and all his chief men, close friends, and priests — until no one was left alive. He completely destroyed Ahab’s house, just as the Lord had said through Elijah.\n\nOn his way to Samaria, Jehu met the relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. They said they were going to visit the royal family of Israel. Jehu ordered his men to capture them and kill them all, forty-two in total."

        text: "Then Jehu met a man named Jehonadab son of Rechab, who was known for his devotion to the Lord. Jehu greeted him and asked if his heart was right toward him. When Jehonadab agreed, Jehu took him into his chariot and said, “Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.” Together they went to Samaria."

        heading: "Eliminating Baal Worship",
        text: "Once in Samaria, Jehu destroyed all who remained of Ahab’s house there as well. But Jehu was not finished yet. He decided to wipe out Baal worship completely from Israel.\n\nJehu announced a great sacrifice for Baal, pretending to be a worshipper. He said, “Ahab served Baal a little; Jehu will serve him much!” He commanded all the prophets, priests, and worshippers of Baal to come together for a grand ceremony in Baal’s temple. No one who served the Lord was to be allowed in.\n\nWhen the temple was full of Baal’s worshippers, Jehu secretly stationed eighty soldiers outside, telling them, “If any of these people escape, you will pay with your life.” Jehu and Jehonadab went inside, pretending to offer sacrifices. Once the ceremony began, Jehu gave the order, and his men killed all the Baal worshippers with their swords.\n\nThey brought out the sacred pillars of Baal, burned them, and destroyed the temple of Baal, turning it into a public toilet place. Thus, Jehu wiped out Baal worship from Israel — a great victory for God’s judgment."

        heading: "Jehu’s Partial Obedience",
        text: "However, even after all this, Jehu did not fully obey the Lord. The Bible says he continued to follow the sins of Jeroboam, keeping the golden calves in Bethel and Dan as idols for the people to worship. He removed Baal but not the false worship that Jeroboam had started.\n\nBecause of Jehu’s partial obedience, God told him that his sons would sit on Israel’s throne for four generations, as a reward for destroying Ahab’s house. But God was not pleased that Jehu’s heart was not fully devoted to Him."

        heading: "Jehu’s Later Reign and Legacy",
        text: "During Jehu’s reign, the Lord began to reduce the size of Israel, as enemies like Hazael king of Aram started to take over parts of Israel’s land. Jehu ruled for 28 years in Samaria. When he died, his son Jehoahaz became king after him.\n\nJehu’s story is both inspiring and tragic. He was chosen by God to carry out judgment and did so with great zeal, courage, and strength. But he failed to follow God with his heart. He destroyed idol worshippers but kept idols himself. He obeyed God in action but not in devotion.\n\nHis life teaches us that zeal without obedience is not enough. God wants not just our actions, but our hearts. Jehu’s chariot drove furiously in judgment, but his heart never rested in faith.\n\nSo King Jehu stands as a reminder that half obedience is still disobedience, and true service to God means following Him fully, not just when it benefits us."
