    "verse_2": "The Lord began to speak to Hosea with a message for his people. The Lord said to Hosea, ‘Go and marry a prostitute. She will give birth to children for you, as a prostitute. That will show how my people have not been faithful to me. They have turned away from me, the Lord, and they have served other gods.’",
    "verse_3": "So Hosea married a woman called Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. Then Gomer became pregnant. She gave birth to a son for Hosea.",
    "verse_4": "The Lord said to Hosea, ‘Call him Jezreel. This is because I will soon punish the family of Jehu. I will punish them because Jehu murdered people at Jezreel. I will cause the kingdom of Israel to come to an end.",

    "verse_6": "Gomer became pregnant again. She gave birth to a daughter. The Lord said to Hosea, ‘Call her Lo-Ruhamah. This is because I will not continue to show love to Israel's people. I will not forgive their sins any more.",
    "verse_7": "But I will continue to love the people of Judah. I will save them from the power of their enemies. I will not use weapons to do this in a battle. I will not use an army, or horses, or chariots. Instead, it will be the power of the Lord their God that saves them.’",
    "verse_8": "After Lo-Ruhamah stopped drinking Gomer's milk, Gomer became pregnant again. She gave birth to another son.",

    "verse_10": "In the future, nobody will be able to count the number of Israel's people. They will be as much as the sand on the shore of the sea. God has said to them, ‘You are not my people.’ But at that time, he will say to them, ‘You are children of the God who lives!’",

She herself said, ‘I will go and sleep with my lovers. They give me food and water. They give me wool, linen, olive oil and wine.’",

    "verse_13": "I will punish her because she burned incense to the idols of Baal. I will punish her because she made herself beautiful with jewels when she went to sleep with her lovers. I will punish her because she did those things but she forgot about me. That is what the Lord says.",
    "verse_14": "But listen! One day, I will speak kind words to her. I will lead her into the wilderness. I will tell her that I love her.",
    "verse_15": "There, I will give her the vineyards that she had before. I will change Trouble Valley into a place where there is hope. She will be happy with me there, as she was when she was young. That was the time when she came out of Egypt.",
    "verse_16": "The Lord says this: When that happens, you will call me, ‘My husband’. You will never again call me, ‘Baal, my master’.",
    "verse_17": "I will never again let you speak the names of the idols of Baal.",
    "verse_18": "At that time, I will make a promise that nothing will hurt my people. I will make an agreement with the wild animals, with the birds in the fields and with the animals that move along the ground. I will remove from their land all the weapons that soldiers use to fight wars. I will destroy their swords and their bows and arrows. I will allow my people to live safely in peace.",

    "verse_20": "I will promise to be a faithful husband for you. Then you will know me as the Lord.",
    "verse_21": "The Lord says this: At that time, I will answer your prayers. I will put clouds in the sky, and the clouds will send rain to the earth.",
    "verse_22": "The earth will feed the grain, the wine and the olive oil. My people will be happy to say, ‘Jezreel: God plants.’",
    "verse_23": "I will plant them safely in the land. I will show love to ‘No love’ (Lo-Ruhamah). I will say to ‘Not my people’ (Lo-Ammi), ‘You are my people.’ And they will say to me, ‘You are my God.’"

    "verse_1": "Then the Lord said to me, ‘Go back to your wife and show that you love her. Do that, even though she loves another man and is not faithful to you. The Lord loves the Israelites in the same way. They turn away from him to worship other gods. They love to offer gifts of raisins to idols. But the Lord still loves them.’",
    "verse_2": "So I paid 15 pieces of silver and 50 kilograms of grain to get my wife back.",
    "verse_3": "Then I told her, ‘You must stay at home with me for many days. You must not live as a prostitute. You must not have sex with any other man. I will also be faithful to you.’",
    "verse_4": "In the same way, the Israelites will have to live for many days without a king or any other leader. They will not be able to make sacrifices. They will not have their pillars, their ephods or their idols to help them.",

    "verse_3": "Because of this, the land will become like a desert. Everyone who lives there will become weak. Everything will die: the wild animals, the birds, and even the fish in the sea.",
    "verse_4": "Do not argue among yourselves or accuse one another. It is you priests who are guilty.",
    "verse_5": "You are always falling over. In the day and in the night, you trip and you fall. The false prophets are the same as you. So I will destroy Israel, your mother.",
    "verse_6": "The people do not know me. Because of that, they will come to an end. You refuse to respect my authority, so I will remove you as my priests. You refuse to obey the law of your God, so I will refuse to accept your children as my priests.",
    "verse_7": "The more priests that there are among you, the more sins they do against me. They should have received honour as priests, but I will make them ashamed.",
    "verse_8": "They get food to eat when the people bring their sin offerings to them. So the priests are happy when the people do bad things, because they get more food to eat.",
    "verse_9": "The people do whatever the priests do. I will punish them all for the bad things that they do. I will give them what their sins deserve.",
    "verse_10": "They will eat, but they will still be hungry. They will have sex with prostitutes, but they will still have no children. This will happen because they have turned away from the Lord.",
    "verse_11": "Instead, they worship other gods. My people cannot think properly because they drink too much old wine and new wine.",
    "verse_12": "They ask wooden idols to tell them what to do! A stick tells them what will happen in the future! They have turned away from me and they have lost their way. They have not been faithful to me, their God, as a prostitute is not faithful to her husband.",
    "verse_13": "They offer sacrifices on the tops of the mountains. They burn offerings on the hills. They do this under the oak trees, the poplar trees and the other big trees. They enjoy the shade under those trees. As a result, your daughters serve the false gods as prostitutes. Your sons' wives are also guilty of adultery.",
    "verse_14": "But I will not punish them for those sins, because the men are just as guilty! They sleep with prostitutes. They join with prostitutes to offer sacrifices to the false gods. All of this shows that people who cannot think properly destroy themselves.’",
    "verse_15": "You people of Israel are not faithful to the Lord. But do not let the people of Judah become guilty of the same sins. Do not travel to Gilgal to worship! Do not go to Beth Aven! Do not say, ‘I promise this is true, as surely as the Lord lives’.",
    "verse_16": "Israel's people have turned against the Lord. They are like a young cow that refuses to obey its owner. So how can the Lord take care of them? Will he put them in a big field to eat the grass like lambs?",
