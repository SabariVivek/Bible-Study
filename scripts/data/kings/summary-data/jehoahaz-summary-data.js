        text: "Jehoahaz was the son of King Jehu and became the next king of Israel after his father’s death. He ruled over the northern kingdom of Israel for seventeen years in Samaria. His reign is written in 2 Kings 13:1–9."

        heading: "Jehoahaz Continues in Sin",
        text: "Even though his father Jehu had destroyed the worship of Baal, Jehoahaz did not fully follow the Lord. He continued to lead the people of Israel into sin. He did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom, who made Israel worship the golden calves in Bethel and Dan. Because of this, the people continued to worship idols instead of the true God."

        heading: "God’s Judgment on Israel",
        text: "God became very angry with Israel because of their continuous disobedience. As a result, the Lord allowed Hazael king of Aram (Syria) and his son Ben-Hadad to defeat Israel again and again. The armies of Israel were weakened, and the nation suffered greatly under the oppression of Aram."

        heading: "Jehoahaz Prays for Deliverance",
        text: "Seeing the suffering of his people, Jehoahaz humbled himself and prayed to the Lord. He begged God for mercy and deliverance from the powerful Aramean kings. God, who is compassionate, heard Jehoahaz’s prayer and sent a deliverer to Israel. The Bible does not mention who this deliverer was, but it might have been his son Joash or Jeroboam II, who later defeated Aram and restored parts of Israel."

        heading: "Israel’s Hearts Remained Hard",
        text: "Even though God showed mercy and gave Israel relief from their enemies, the people did not truly change their hearts. They continued to sin and worship idols. The image of the Asherah pole remained standing in Samaria, showing that idol worship was still strong in the land."

        heading: "Israel’s Military Weakness",
        text: "During Jehoahaz’s time, the military strength of Israel became extremely weak. The Bible says he was left with only fifty horsemen, ten chariots, and ten thousand foot soldiers. The rest of the army had been destroyed by the Aramean king. This shows how much Israel had fallen because of sin and rebellion against God."

        heading: "Jehoahaz’s Death and Legacy",
        text: "When Jehoahaz died, he was buried in Samaria, and his son Joash (also called Jehoash) became the next king after him.\n\nJehoahaz’s story teaches a strong lesson. Even though he prayed to God and received mercy, he did not lead the people into a true repentance. He asked for help when he was in trouble, but he did not change his ways afterward. God was faithful to answer his prayer, but the people’s hearts remained far from Him.\n\nSo, Jehoahaz’s reign is remembered as a time of suffering, prayer, and partial deliverance, but not as a time of spiritual change. His story reminds us that God listens when we cry out, but He also desires obedience and a faithful heart that turns away from sin."
