        heading: "King Jehoram – The Brother of Ahaziah Who Rejected God's Power and Faced His Judgment",
        text: "Jehoram, also called Joram, was the son of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel, and the brother of King Ahaziah. After Ahaziah died without a son, Jehoram became the king of the northern kingdom of Israel. His reign is recorded in 2 Kings chapters 3, 6, 7, and 8. He ruled for twelve years, and though he removed some of the idol worship practices that his parents had introduced, he still continued to do evil in the eyes of the Lord. His story shows how a man can try to make small changes but still remain far from true obedience to God."

        heading: "Jehoram Takes the Throne",
        text: "When Jehoram came to the throne, Israel was in a broken condition. His father Ahab and his mother Jezebel had led the nation deeply into idol worship, especially the worship of Baal. God had already sent many judgments during their time, including drought, famine, and war. Ahaziah, Jehoram’s brother, had continued those sins and died early because of his rebellion. Jehoram could have learned from all these warnings. He saw how both his parents and his brother had faced God’s anger, but instead of fully turning to the Lord, he only made partial changes."

        heading: "Jehoram’s Partial Reforms",
        text: "The Bible says that Jehoram removed the pillar of Baal that his father Ahab had made, but he did not stop the people from worshipping the golden calves at Bethel and Dan, which had been introduced long ago by Jeroboam. So, while he removed one form of idolatry, he kept another. This shows that his heart was not truly devoted to God—he was trying to mix a little obedience with disobedience."

        heading: "The Rebellion of Moab",
        text: "During Jehoram’s reign, one of his first problems was that the kingdom of Moab rebelled against Israel. Moab had been paying tribute (taxes) to Israel ever since the days of King David, but after the death of Ahab, they saw an opportunity to break free. King Mesha of Moab stopped sending tribute to Israel, and Jehoram decided to go to war to bring them back under control."

        heading: "Jehoram Seeks Help from Jehoshaphat",
        text: "To prepare for battle, Jehoram gathered his army and also sent a message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah, asking for his help. Jehoshaphat agreed, and the king of Edom also joined them. Together, the three kings marched through the desert of Edom to attack Moab from an unexpected direction. But after marching for seven days, they ran out of water for their soldiers and animals. The situation became desperate."

        heading: "The Three Kings Seek Elisha",
        text: "When the kings realized they were in trouble, Jehoram panicked and said, “The Lord has called us three kings together only to deliver us into the hand of Moab!” But Jehoshaphat, who was a godly king, said, “Is there no prophet of the Lord here, that we may inquire of the Lord by him?” One of Jehoram’s officers said that Elisha, the prophet who had served Elijah, was nearby. So the three kings went to meet Elisha."

        text: "When Elisha saw Jehoram, he was not pleased. He said, “What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and mother!” He was reminding Jehoram that his parents had worshipped false gods. But because King Jehoshaphat of Judah was with him—a man who honored God—Elisha agreed to speak to them on God’s behalf. He said, “If it were not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat, I would not look toward you, nor see you.”"

        text: "Then Elisha called for a musician, and while the music played, the hand of the Lord came upon him. God gave a message through Elisha: “Make this valley full of ditches. For thus says the Lord, you shall not see wind, nor shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, so that you may drink—you, your cattle, and your animals.” God also promised them victory over Moab. The next morning, as the sun rose, water suddenly flowed into the valley, just as Elisha had said, though there had been no rain."

        heading: "The Defeat of Moab",
        text: "When the Moabites saw the water shining red in the sunlight, they thought it was blood. They believed the three kings had turned against each other and killed one another. So they rushed into the camp to plunder it, but the Israelites attacked them and won the battle. The Moabites fled, and Israel destroyed their cities, cut down trees, and stopped up springs of water, just as Elisha had said. However, when the Moabite king saw he was losing, he made a terrible sacrifice—he offered his own son as a burnt offering on the city wall. The sight shocked everyone, and Israel withdrew from Moab."

        heading: "Jehoram’s Continued Unbelief",
        text: "Even after seeing God’s power and mercy through this miracle, Jehoram did not completely turn to God. Later, during his reign, Syria (Aram) became a constant enemy to Israel. The king of Syria sent his armies several times to attack Israel, but each time, God revealed their plans to the prophet Elisha, who warned the king of Israel. This made the Syrian king furious, and he sent soldiers to capture Elisha. But God miraculously blinded the Syrian army, and Elisha led them straight into the city of Samaria. When their eyes were opened, they realized they were surrounded by Israel’s soldiers. Instead of killing them, Elisha told the king to give them food and send them home. This act of mercy brought temporary peace."

        heading: "The Siege and Famine in Samaria",
        text: "However, the peace did not last. Later, Ben-Hadad, the king of Syria, laid siege to Samaria, the capital of Israel. The city faced a terrible famine—food was so scarce that people sold a donkey’s head for a huge price, and the situation became horrifying. When Jehoram heard about the suffering, instead of repenting or calling on God for help, he blamed Elisha and said, “May God punish me if the head of Elisha remains on him today!” Jehoram’s heart had grown hard, and even in such misery, he turned against the man of God rather than against his own sin."

        heading: "Elisha’s Prophecy and God’s Deliverance",
        text: "But God, through Elisha, showed mercy again. Elisha prophesied that within one day, food would become plentiful and cheap. The next day, God caused the Syrian army to hear the sound of a great army coming, so they fled in fear, leaving all their supplies behind. The Israelites went out and found food, silver, and goods in abundance, just as God had promised."

        heading: "Jehoram’s Death and God’s Judgment",
        text: "Even after witnessing all these miracles, Jehoram still did not turn fully to the Lord. His twelve-year reign was filled with moments when he saw God’s hand clearly, yet he refused to change his heart. Eventually, Jehoram was wounded in battle against the Syrians at Ramoth-Gilead and returned to Jezreel to recover. While he was there, God raised up Jehu, a military commander, to bring judgment upon Ahab’s family. Jehu rode to Jezreel and shot Jehoram with an arrow that pierced his heart. His body was thrown into the field that once belonged to Naboth, fulfilling Elijah’s earlier prophecy that God’s judgment would fall on Ahab’s house for his wickedness."

        heading: "Lessons from Jehoram’s Life",
        text: "Jehoram’s story ends as a warning. He was a man who had many chances to change but never truly repented. He saw God’s power again and again through the prophet Elisha, but his heart remained proud and unbelieving. He tried to balance between sin and obedience, but in the end, he lost everything."

    {
        heading: "The Legacy of King Jehoram",
        text: "King Jehoram’s life shows that knowing about God’s miracles is not the same as knowing God Himself. He had every opportunity to lead Israel back to the Lord, but he wasted them all. His death, like his father Ahab’s, came as the result of God’s judgment. Thus, Jehoram’s story is another sad reminder in Israel’s history that when leaders ignore God’s warnings and follow their own way, their reign ends in failure and their name is remembered only as a warning to others."
