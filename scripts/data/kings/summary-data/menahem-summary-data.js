        heading: "King Menahem – The Cruel King Who Bought Peace with Silver",
        text: "King Menahem was one of the later kings of Israel, ruling during a very troubled time in the northern kingdom’s history. His story is found in 2 Kings 15:14–22. Menahem ruled Israel for ten years in Samaria, but his reign was marked by violence, cruelty, and oppression. He was known as a harsh ruler who maintained his power through fear and used wealth to buy peace from foreign enemies instead of trusting in God."

        heading: "Chaos After Jeroboam II’s Death",
        text: "Before Menahem became king, the kingdom of Israel was in chaos. After the death of King Jeroboam II, there was no stability in the nation. His son Zechariah ruled only for six months before being murdered by Shallum, who took the throne. But Shallum himself ruled for only one month before Menahem rose against him."

    {
        heading: "Menahem Takes the Throne by Force",
        text: "Menahem was from the city of Tirzah, and when he heard that Shallum had become king, he marched from Tirzah to Samaria, the capital city of Israel. There, he attacked Shallum, killed him, and took the throne for himself. This marked yet another violent change in leadership, showing how unstable Israel had become because of its disobedience to God."

    {
        heading: "Menahem’s Cruelty at Tiphsah",
        text: "After killing Shallum, Menahem began his reign by showing extreme cruelty to those who opposed him. One of the most shocking events in his story is how he treated the city of Tiphsah. When the people of Tiphsah refused to open their gates to him and did not accept his rule, Menahem attacked the city. He destroyed it completely and did something terribly cruel — he ripped open the pregnant women of the city. This act revealed how brutal and merciless Menahem was. He ruled with an iron hand and wanted everyone to fear him."

        heading: "The Assyrian Threat and Menahem’s Response",
        text: "During his reign, Israel faced pressure from a powerful enemy — Assyria, one of the greatest empires in the world at that time. The king of Assyria, named Pul (who is also known as Tiglath-Pileser III in history), came to attack the land of Israel. Instead of turning to God for help or leading the people to repentance, Menahem tried to buy peace. He gave Pul a large amount of silver, about one thousand talents (which would be several tons of silver). This was an enormous payment."

    {
        heading: "Forcing the Wealthy to Pay Tribute",
        text: "To collect this massive tribute, Menahem forced the wealthy people of Israel to pay. He demanded fifty shekels of silver from each rich man in the country. By doing this, he gathered enough money to send to the king of Assyria. His payment made the Assyrian king withdraw and allow Menahem to remain on his throne. In other words, Menahem bought his kingdom’s safety instead of trusting God for protection."

    {
        heading: "Israel’s Spiritual and Moral Weakness",
        text: "Although this action gave temporary peace, it showed how weak and dependent Israel had become. Instead of being the strong nation that once followed God under kings like David and Solomon, Israel was now paying foreign rulers to avoid war. The kingdom was spiritually and morally broken, and Menahem’s reign showed how far they had fallen from God’s commands."
    },
    {
        heading: "Menahem’s Evil in God’s Sight",
        text: "The Bible clearly says that Menahem did evil in the sight of the Lord. He continued in the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had led Israel into idol worship many years earlier. Like most of the kings of the northern kingdom, Menahem never tried to remove the golden calves or stop the people from worshipping false gods. He did not seek the Lord or guide the people back to true worship."
    },
    {
        heading: "A Reign of Fear and Corruption",
        text: "Because of this, his reign — though lasting ten years — did not bring blessing or peace to Israel. Instead, it was a time of fear, oppression, and corruption. His decisions only made the people’s hearts harder and the nation weaker."
    },
    {
        heading: "Menahem’s Death and Legacy",
        text: "When Menahem died, his son Pekahiah became king after him. The Bible records very little about Menahem beyond his cruelty, his payment to Assyria, and his refusal to follow God. His name is remembered not for faith or courage but for violence and compromise."
    },
    {
        heading: "Lesson from King Menahem’s Life",
        text: "King Menahem’s story is a sad reflection of what happens when leaders try to secure power and peace through human strength and wealth instead of through trust in God. He ruled with cruelty and bought peace with silver, but he never found true peace with God. His reign reminds us that no amount of money or power can save a person or a nation that has turned away from the Lord."
