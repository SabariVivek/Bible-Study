But when Samuel didn’t come on time and the soldiers started to scatter, Saul grew impatient and offered the sacrifice himself — something only the priest or prophet was allowed to do. Just as he finished, Samuel arrived and rebuked him, saying, 'You have done foolishly. Your kingdom will not last. The Lord has sought a man after His own heart.' That man was David, though Saul didn’t know it yet."

But Saul spared King Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle, claiming he wanted to offer them to God. When Samuel came, he said, 'What is this bleating of sheep that I hear?' Saul tried to defend himself, but Samuel replied, 'To obey is better than sacrifice.' Because of this sin, God rejected Saul as king."

Saul tried to seek God’s guidance, but God did not answer him through dreams, prophets, or priests. In desperation, Saul went to a witch at Endor to summon the spirit of Samuel — something God had forbidden. The spirit of Samuel appeared and told Saul that God had left him and that he and his sons would die in battle the next day."
    },
    {
        heading: "The Death of Saul and His Sons",
        text: "The next day, the Philistines attacked on Mount Gilboa. Saul’s sons — Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua — were killed. Saul was badly wounded by the archers. Rather than be captured by his enemies, Saul fell on his own sword and died. His armor-bearer also killed himself."

But the brave men of Jabesh Gilead, the same people Saul had rescued years earlier, came by night, took his body, and buried him with honor."
