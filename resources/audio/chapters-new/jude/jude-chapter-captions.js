            text: "This letter was written by Jude, who calls himself a servant of Jesus Christ and a brother of James. He writes to those who are loved by God the Father, kept safe by Jesus Christ, and called to be His followers. Jude begins with a blessing, wishing them mercy, peace, and love in abundance."
        },
        {
            text: "Jude says that he had wanted to write to them about the salvation they share, but he felt it was more important to warn them to stand firm in their faith. He urges them to defend the truth of the faith that God has once and for all given to His people. He warns that some ungodly people have secretly joined their groups. These people twist God’s grace into an excuse for sinful living and deny Jesus Christ as their only Lord and Master."
        },
        {
            text: "Jude reminds them that although God once saved the Israelites out of Egypt, He later punished those who did not believe. He also reminds them about the angels who did not stay in their proper positions but left their place in heaven—God has kept them locked up in darkness until the day of judgment. He mentions Sodom and Gomorrah as examples of those who committed sexual sins and went after unnatural desires. Those cities were destroyed by fire as a warning to others."
        },
        {
            text: "Then Jude talks about the false teachers in his own time. He says that these people are proud, follow their sinful desires, and reject authority. They speak evil of heavenly beings, even though they don’t understand what they are talking about. Jude gives an example from a story where the archangel Michael argued with the devil about Moses’ body—Michael did not insult the devil but simply said, “The Lord rebuke you!” Yet these false people speak badly about things they know nothing about, and what they do understand by instinct—like unreasoning animals—leads to their destruction."
        },
        {
            text: "Jude compares them to Cain, who killed his brother; to Balaam, who sinned for money; and to Korah, who rebelled against God’s authority. He calls them hidden dangers at fellowship meals, selfish shepherds who only care about themselves, clouds without rain, trees without fruit, wild waves throwing up their shame like foam, and wandering stars for whom darkness is reserved forever."
        },
        {
            text: "Jude then quotes a prophecy from Enoch, the seventh from Adam, who said that the Lord will come with thousands of His holy ones to judge everyone and punish the ungodly for all their evil deeds and harsh words spoken against Him. Jude says these false teachers are grumblers, complainers, and people who follow their own sinful desires. They boast about themselves and flatter others for their own advantage."
        },
        {
            text: "But Jude encourages the believers to remember what the apostles of Jesus Christ had said—that in the last times, there would be people who mock the truth and follow their own ungodly desires. Such people cause divisions because they live by their natural instincts and do not have the Holy Spirit."
        },
        {
            text: "Jude tells the believers to keep themselves strong in their faith, pray in the power of the Holy Spirit, stay in God’s love, and wait for the mercy of Jesus Christ that brings eternal life. He also tells them to show kindness to those who doubt, rescue others from the fire of judgment, and show mercy—but with fear, hating even the sin that stains people’s lives."
        },
        {
            text: "The letter ends with a beautiful praise to God: “Now to Him who is able to keep you from falling and to bring you faultless and joyful into His glorious presence—to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord—be glory, majesty, power, and authority, before all time, now and forever. Amen.”"
