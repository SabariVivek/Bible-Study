            text: "The <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew is an account of Jesus’ life. It records what Jesus taught. And it records what Jesus did.\n\nMatthew began his <b>Gospel</b> with a list of the <b>ancestors</b> of Jesus. The record is from Abraham to Joseph, the husband of Mary. Joseph was not the father of Jesus. But in <b>Jewish</b> law, Jesus belonged to Joseph’s family. Luke records the history from Jesus back to Adam. It might be that Luke recorded the <b>ancestors</b> of Mary’s family. But we are not sure about this. Both Joseph and Mary were <b>descendants</b> of King David and of Abraham.\n\nJesus was called ‘the son of David’. This meant that he was a direct male <b>descendant</b> of King David. The <b>Jews</b> understood that ‘the son of David’ referred to the <b>Christ</b> (Matthew 22:41-46). In Jesus’ day, many <b>Jews</b> expected the <b>Christ</b> to come. And several times Jesus was called ‘son of David’ (Matthew 9:27, 12:23, 15:22, 20:30, 21:9, 21:15). We sometimes refer to the <b>Christ</b> as ‘King David’s greater son’. In other words, Jesus is a <b>descendant</b> of David, but he is more important than David. Jesus is both the <b>Christ</b> and the king. He is the king of the <b>Jews</b>.\n\nJesus was also called ‘the son of Abraham’. This meant that he was a direct male <b>descendant</b> of Abraham. Abraham was the <b>ancestor</b> of the <b>Jews</b>. To them he was their ‘father’. And they were proud to be his <b>descendants</b>. The word ‘father’ did not always mean the immediate parent. It often meant an earlier <b>ancestor</b>. It would be by a <b>descendant</b> of Abraham that God would <b>bless</b> all nations (Genesis 22:18). God did this by means of what Jesus achieved by his death. The death of Jesus was for all people. He told his <b>disciples</b> to <b>preach</b> the good news about him to all nations (Matthew 28:18-20). So by means of Jesus, the <b>Christ</b>, God <b>blesses</b> people from every nation.\n\nThe <b>Jews</b> considered their family history to be very important. From early times, there were public records. Matthew arranges the history in three groups.\n\n- The first group is from Abraham to David (Matthew 1:2-6).\n- The second group is from Solomon to the <b>exile</b> in Babylon (Matthew 1:7-11).\n- Then the final group is from Jechoniah to the birth of Jesus (Matthew 1:12-16).\n\nMatthew makes this to be three sets of 14 names in each (Matthew 1:17). It is not clear why Matthew did this. But in order to achieve it, Matthew has left out some names. In the second group after Jotham, Matthew has left out Ahaziah, Joash and Amaziah (1 Chronicles 3:11-12). The third group is for a period of about 500 years. Matthew records only 13 names for this period.",
            note: "<p>There are four unusual aspects of the genealogy presented by Matthew:</p><ul><li>It includes women (Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba, and Mary.)</li><li>It includes bad people</li><li>It includes Gentiles</li><li>It includes Rahab, a Gentile woman who was a prostitute</li></ul>"

            text: "Tamar is the first of 5 women that Matthew includes in the list. It was not usual to include women in the family lists. Also, she was not married to Judah when they had Perez and Zerah. She had been the wife of Judah’s son Er, but he died. The law at that time was that the next son should marry the widow. Onan would not have children for his brother Er, and Onan died. Judah would not allow Tamar to marry his other sons. The story of how she had sons by Judah is in Genesis chapter 38. Matthew mentions both Perez and Zerah. This may be because they were born at the same time.\n\nThe second woman in the list is Rahab. She was a foreigner. But she had helped the <b>Israelite</b> men who had come to Jericho. So, the <b>Israelites</b> saved her when they destroyed Jericho (Joshua chapter 6). Later she became the mother of Boaz.\n\nThe next woman in the list is Ruth. She was a foreigner from the country called Moab. Ruth married Boaz (Ruth 4:10-12).\n\nWhen Matthew came to David, he called him King David. Matthew made it clear that Jesus was from the royal family. It was right that Jesus was called the king of the <b>Jews</b>.\n\nAminadab was in the desert with Moses (Numbers 1:7). That was about 400 years after the <b>Israelites</b> went to Egypt. In this list, there are just 4 names for that period. They are Perez, Hezron, Aram and Aminadab. So, Matthew must have left out several names here. In the same way, he may have left out some names between Aminadab and David."

So, Bathsheba is the 4th woman in the list but Matthew does not record her name.\n\nFrom the family of King David, his <b>descendants</b> ruled as kings until the <b>exile</b> in Babylon. From then on, <b>Israel</b> had no kings."

But perhaps Matthew counted Jesus as the 14th name.\n\nWe have no other record of the 9 names from Abiud to Jacob. Probably they were in public or family records that Matthew copied.\n\nThe list ends with Joseph. He was Mary’s husband. She is the 5th woman in this list. Joseph was not the natural father of Jesus but he was the legal father. All the other men in the list had natural fathers. But Jesus had no human father. Jesus was the <b>Son of God</b>."

            text: "To be engaged to marry was a more serious state than it is in many societies today. It was a legal contract by the couple about a year before the marriage. Then, even before the marriage, people called the couple husband and wife. The girl would remain in her parent’s house until the marriage. And the couple would not have sex until the marriage. To break off the agreement to marry would be a legal divorce.\n\nJoseph’s first thought was that Mary had not been loyal to him. That was until the <b>angel</b> told him otherwise. Joseph found that Mary was expecting a baby. She had not had sex with a man. The baby was by the <b>Holy Spirit</b>. We are sure that Mary would have told Joseph the truth. But he could not believe it then. He thought that it was impossible to have a baby without sex.\n\nJoseph was a good man. In the circumstances, he thought that the marriage could not happen. However, he would not make the matter public. He decided to have a private divorce. This would be the kindest thing to do for Mary. In this way, he could avoid open shame. A secret divorce was not difficult for a man. He must give to Mary a letter of divorce. There had to be two witnesses to the divorce. Then he could send her away from him."

            text: "Joseph did not act in a hurry. He thought about the situation. He had decided what to do. Then he had a dream. God sent an <b>angel</b> to Joseph in that dream. The <b>angel</b> called Joseph 'son of David'. This may have been to emphasise that Jesus would be a king from the family of David. The <b>angel</b> then told Joseph not to be afraid to take Mary as his wife. This does not mean that Joseph was afraid. Rather it means that he should not hesitate to take Mary as his wife. To take her meant to complete the marriage. The man would go to the bride’s house. And he would take her from there to his own house. Then they would have the wedding meal to complete the marriage.\n\nThe <b>angel</b> explained to Joseph the truth about this situation. The child inside Mary was not because of sex with a man. The power of the <b>Holy Spirit</b> had done this. Joseph was not the father of the child. But by his marriage to Mary, he would make Jesus legally his child.\n\nMary’s child would be a son. It was normal for the father to choose the child’s name. But God told Joseph to give to the child the name Jesus. To give the name to the child would be to accept the child as if it was his own. So, by Joseph, Jesus was a <b>descendant</b> of David. Also, Jesus was a <b>descendant</b> of David by Mary. But it was important to the <b>Jews</b> that Jesus was a <b>descendant</b> by the father of the family.\n\nThe name Jesus was the same as the <b>Old Testament</b> name Joshua. The name means ‘the <b>Lord saves</b>.’ The <b>angel</b> told Joseph that Jesus would save his people from their <b>sins</b>. Jesus came to deal with <b>sins</b>. He did this by his life and death. He took the punishment for the <b>sins</b> of the world. So, he is able to save people from their <b>sins</b>."

            text: "God had spoken by the <b>prophets</b> about future events. Much of what the <b>prophets</b> said happened in Jesus. Jesus was the <b>Christ</b> that God promised to send. In this <b>Gospel</b>, Matthew shows how the <b>prophecies</b> actually happened (Matthew 1:22, 2:15, 2:17, 2:23, 4:14, 8:17, 12:17, 13:35, 21:4, 26:56, 27:9).\n\nThe <b>prophecy</b> here is what God spoke by the <b>prophet</b> Isaiah (Isaiah 7:14). As Matthew often does, here he follows the <b>Old Testament</b> in the <b>Greek</b> language. The <b>Old Testament</b> that we use is a translation from the <b>Hebrew</b> language. That explains why some of the words are different from our <b>Old Testament</b>. Isaiah had written about how a young woman would give birth. That birth was evidence that God would save his people from their enemies. His word for a young woman could mean a woman who had never had sex. That is how Matthew understood Isaiah’s <b>prophecy</b>. Mary had not had sex. And her son, Jesus, is the <b>Christ</b> who saves his people from their <b>sins</b>.\n\nWe do not read that anyone called Jesus by the name Emmanuel. But we know Jesus by that name. In his birth, Jesus was human. His birth was not his beginning. Before he came to earth, he was God. And when he came to earth, he was still God. He was Emmanuel. Emmanuel means ‘God is with us.’\n\nJoseph woke up from his sleep. He did what the <b>angel</b> had said to him. Joseph publicly accepted Mary as his wife. He took her to his home. But Joseph and Mary did not have sex until after the birth of her first son. Later they had other children. Among them were James, Joseph, Simon and Judas (Matthew 13:55).\n\nJoseph gave to Jesus the name Jesus. By this act, he legally adopted Jesus as his son."

            section: "Wise Men Seek the King <span class='verse-badge luke'>Verses 1-6</span>",
            text: "Jesus was born while Herod the Great was king. Herod was not a <b>Jew</b> but the <b>Romans</b> made him king over Judea in 40 <b>BC</b>. Herod was born in 73 <b>BC</b>. And the most probable date of his death was in 4 <b>BC</b>. He was a strong and cruel ruler. However, he did some great things so they called him ‘the Great’. He was a great builder. Among his works, he built again Samaria city, which he called Sebaste. He is probably most famous for the <b>temple</b> that he built in Jerusalem city.\n\nTherefore, Jesus was born in or before 4 <b>BC</b>. Probably, the birth of Jesus was a year or two earlier than 4 <b>BC</b>. A man called Dionysius Exiguus in 6th century <b>AD</b> formed our calendar with the years <b>BC</b> (before Christ) and <b>AD</b>. He seems to have made a mistake of between 4 and 6 years.\n\nJesus was born in the town called Bethlehem. The name ‘Bethlehem’ means ‘house of bread.’ Bethlehem was about 5 miles (8 kilometres) south of Jerusalem city. Bethlehem was the royal town where King David had been born. Jesus was born in Bethlehem because Joseph and Mary had to go there (Luke 2:1-7). Their home was in Nazareth town.\n\nSome wise men came from the east to Jerusalem city. God had guided them to Judea. It seems that he did this by means of a star. In the Bible, people often saw God’s <b>glory</b> as a bright light (Exodus 13:21). In Numbers 24:17, the ‘star’ is a word-picture for a king.\n\nThere is a traditional idea that the wise men were using the stars to tell the future. However, Deuteronomy 18:9-13 says that such practices are wicked. God’s law does not allow people to do such things. The first Christians believed that such behaviour was very wrong (Acts 19:18-19).\n\nMatthew does not tell us how many wise men came. By tradition, there were three of them but that is not a fact. In some traditions, there were 12 wise men. By the end of the 6th century <b>AD</b>, someone had given names to the three wise men. These names were Melkon (later Melchior), Balthasar, and Gasper. Sometimes people call them kings but this is unlikely. We do not know where they came from. While they were still in the east, they saw a new star. They understood what this new star meant. To them it meant that a king would be born in Judea. So, they travelled to Jerusalem, Judea’s capital city.\n\nThe wise men asked about the child who was born to be the king of the <b>Jews</b>. They knew that the birth of Jesus had happened by then. They had seen the star up to about 2 years before. They must have heard that the <b>Jews</b> expected the <b>Christ</b> to come. And to the wise men, the star meant that the king of the <b>Jews</b> had been born. Therefore, they had come to <b>worship</b> him. This means that, at that time, Jesus was up to 2 years old. However, probably Jesus was about a year old. Herod killed those boys under 2 years old to make sure that he did not miss Jesus.\n\nWe have no idea what this star was. Many people have suggested possible natural answers. None of these explanations seems to be good enough. Other people believe in a special star for which there cannot be a normal explanation.\n\nKing Herod heard that the wise men had come. The news of the birth of a new king worried him. Also, it worried the people in Jerusalem. Herod was afraid that he would lose his royal power as king.\n\nSomehow, he knew that this new king would be the <b>Christ</b>. And he wanted to kill the child as soon as possible. He needed to know where the <b>Christ</b> would be born. So, he called together the experts who could tell him. The chief priests and the teachers of the law knew that the <b>Christ</b> would come from Bethlehem. So, they told Herod what the Bible said.\n\nGod had shown to Micah the <b>prophet</b> that the ruler would come from Bethlehem. There was another Bethlehem town but this Bethlehem was the one in Judah (Micah 5:2). By the time of Jesus, Judah had become Judea. This ruler would be like a <b>shepherd</b> for <b>Israel</b> (Micah 5:4). The Bible and the <b>Jews</b> often referred to the kings of <b>Israel</b> as <b>shepherds</b>. In this, the <b>Christ</b> would be like King David. David was a <b>shepherd</b> before he became king. God said about David that he would be the <b>shepherd</b> of God’s people <b>Israel</b> (2 Samuel 5:2)."

            text: "Now Herod knew where the <b>Christ</b> had been born. Herod did not want the public to know of his interest. He was already making plans to kill the baby Jesus. So, he asked the wise men to come to see him secretly. He asked them the exact date when they first saw the star. He did not tell them why he wanted to know this. But it gave to him the maximum age of the child. The birth of the child could have been up to two years before this time (Matthew 2:16).\n\nHerod told the wise men that the new king had been born in Bethlehem town. Then he sent them there to find the little child. He asked them to come back to him. He wanted them to tell him where the child was. He said that he wanted to <b>worship</b> the child. The wise men believed Herod. Herod seemed to be as eager as they were to find the new baby king. It is strange that Herod did not send anyone else with the wise men. Maybe he did not send anyone else to show that he trusted the wise men. And he did expect them to come back to him.\n\nThe wise men set out to go to Bethlehem town. They travelled by night. And when they went, they saw the star again. They first saw the star in the east. The star seemed to be moving ahead of them. Then it stopped over the place where Jesus was. We do not know how the star could show to them the exact place. Probably it seemed to stop over Bethlehem town. Bethlehem was a very small town. And the wise men could have asked the local people where the child was. By this time, Joseph and Mary had moved into a house. The wise men found the house, and they were very glad.\n\nThe wise men went into the house. They saw the child and his mother Mary. Matthew does not mention Joseph. We do not know whether he was at home. The wise men fell down and they <b>worshipped</b> Jesus. Then they opened their luggage and they took out gold, <b>frankincense</b> and <b>myrrh</b>. Then they gave these valuable gifts to Jesus. These gifts may have helped Joseph and Mary to afford the journey to Egypt (Matthew 2:13).\n\n<b>Frankincense</b> is a white sticky substance that comes from certain trees. It has a sweet smell. People used <b>frankincense</b> as a medicine. Also they used it to carry out certain ceremonies in their religion. And <b>myrrh</b> was a substance from a certain bush. <b>Myrrh</b> was a precious <b>spice</b> with a sweet smell. People used <b>myrrh</b> on the bodies of people that had died. It helped to preserve the bodies.\n\nChristians often see meanings in these gifts. In their opinion, gold means that Jesus was a king. <b>Frankincense</b> means that Jesus was God. And <b>myrrh</b> was because Jesus would suffer. <b>Myrrh</b> was to show the death of Jesus.\n\nThen God spoke to the wise men in a dream. He told them not to go back to Herod. Matthew records no reason for this. But God warned them. Perhaps God told them something of Herod’s intentions. However, the wise men obeyed God. They went home by a different route."

Herod knew that Jesus had been born in Bethlehem. If he found Jesus, Herod would kill him. Joseph and his family would be safe in Egypt. And they must stay there until Herod had died. The <b>Lord</b> would tell Joseph when it was safe to return home.\n\nJoseph did what the <b>angel</b> had told him. They started their journey by night. It was a long journey. It would have been more than 200 miles (320 kilometres). It would have taken them many days to get to Egypt. Egypt was a safe place for them to live. Herod could have no authority there. And about a million <b>Jews</b> lived there. Many of these <b>Jews</b> had come to Egypt to be safe from the rulers in <b>Israel</b>.\n\nThe family stayed in Egypt until Herod died.
