He lived in Jerusalem and served as God’s messenger during the reigns of four kings of Judah—Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah—around the 8th century BC. Isaiah’s name means “The Lord is salvation,” and that meaning truly describes his message. His writings reveal the holiness of God, the sin of His people, and the promise of salvation through the coming Messiah. Isaiah’s ministry lasted for about sixty years, and he lived during a time when the nation of Judah looked strong on the outside but was spiritually corrupt on the inside."

Though they still went to the temple and offered sacrifices, their hearts were far from God. Isaiah was called by God to speak against their sins and warn them of judgment if they did not repent."

Isaiah saw a vision of the Lord sitting on a high throne, surrounded by heavenly beings called seraphim, who were crying out, “Holy, holy, holy is the Lord Almighty; the whole earth is full of His glory.” The sight of God’s holiness made Isaiah realize his own sinfulness. He cried out, “Woe is me! I am ruined, for I am a man of unclean lips and I live among a people of unclean lips.” Then one of the seraphim took a burning coal from the altar and touched Isaiah’s lips, saying his sin was forgiven. After that, God asked, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?” Isaiah immediately answered, “Here am I, send me.” This marked the beginning of his powerful ministry as God’s prophet."

He told them that foreign nations like Assyria and later Babylon would be used by God to punish them.

That very night, the angel of the Lord struck down 185,000 Assyrian soldiers, proving that God could protect His people without any human help. Isaiah also warned Hezekiah that although Assyria would fall, Babylon would one day come and carry Judah into exile because of their pride and sin."

He says, “He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows and familiar with suffering. He was pierced for our transgressions and crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was upon Him, and by His wounds we are healed.” These words are a clear prophecy about Jesus Christ, who would come many centuries later to die for the sins of the world."

He even gave a powerful sermon in the temple, saying that if they continued to sin, the temple would become like Shiloh, the place where God’s presence once dwelled but later was abandoned because of sin.

This early test showed Daniel's courage and commitment to obey God no matter the cost."

When the king threatened to kill all his advisors, Daniel prayed to God for help, and God revealed the meaning of the dream to him. Daniel then told the king that the dream showed a great statue made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, and clay. These parts represented a series of kingdoms that would rise and fall in history, beginning with Babylon as the head of gold. But Daniel said that one day, God would establish a kingdom that would never be destroyed—a kingdom that would last forever. This was a prophecy about God's eternal rule through the coming Messiah. Nebuchadnezzar was amazed and honored Daniel, acknowledging that his God was truly the God of gods."

Darius was deeply troubled because he liked Daniel, but the law could not be changed. So Daniel was thrown into a den of lions. That night, the king could not sleep and fasted for Daniel. Early the next morning, he rushed to the den and called out, <b>Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?</b> Daniel answered that God had sent His angel to shut the lions' mouths, and they had not hurt him because he was innocent. The king was overjoyed and ordered Daniel to be taken out. Then the men who had plotted against him were thrown into the den, and the lions crushed them instantly.

Even though his book is short, it carries a very strong and powerful message about God’s justice, judgment, and faithfulness. The name “Obadiah” means “servant of the Lord” or “worshiper of Yahweh,” which fits him perfectly because his prophecy shows his deep loyalty to God and his concern for how nations treat God’s people."

When Jerusalem was attacked by foreign nations—most likely the Babylonians—Edom did not come to help. Instead, they rejoiced at Judah’s suffering, captured escaping Israelites, and handed them over to their enemies. Some Edomites even looted the city and took part in the destruction."

They lived in the rocky mountains of Seir, with homes built high in the cliffs, and they thought no one could ever bring them down. But God told them that even if they soared like an eagle or built their nest among the stars, He would bring them down.

Obadiah listed their sins clearly: they stood by when strangers invaded Jerusalem, they rejoiced over Judah’s downfall, they entered the city to plunder it, they captured survivors trying to escape, and they handed them over to their enemies. God saw all of this, and He promised that Edom would face the same kind of destruction and humiliation that they had caused for others."

God gave Jonah a special mission—to go to the great city of Nineveh, the capital of the Assyrian Empire, and preach against its wickedness. The people of Nineveh were known for their cruelty, violence, and sin, and God wanted them to repent. But Jonah did not want to go.

The captain woke him and urged him to pray to his God. When the sailors cast lots to find out who was responsible for the storm, the lot fell on Jonah. He told them that he was a Hebrew and that he worshiped the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land.

Jonah was inside the belly of the fish for three days and three nights. During that time, he prayed to God from inside the fish.

To Jonah’s surprise, the people of Nineveh believed his message. They declared a fast, wore sackcloth as a sign of sorrow for their sins, and even the king of Nineveh stepped down from his throne, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

Nahum shows that while God is patient, He will not allow sin and cruelty to continue forever. The Lord’s way is in the whirlwind and storm, and the clouds are the dust of His feet.

The people had turned away from God, and their leaders were unjust and greedy. Habakkuk saw all this evil around him and could not understand why God seemed silent and inactive. His book is a journey from confusion and fear to faith and trust in God’s perfect wisdom and timing."

Why do You tolerate wrongdoing?” He was deeply troubled by the injustice in Judah—the law was ignored, the wicked surrounded the righteous, and justice never seemed to prevail. Habakkuk could not understand why God was allowing such evil to continue unchecked. In response, God answered him in a surprising way. God told Habakkuk that He was not ignoring the situation but was preparing to bring judgment on Judah through the Babylonians, also called the Chaldeans—a fierce and ruthless nation that would invade and punish the people for their sins. This answer shocked Habakkuk even more. He could not understand why God would use a nation more wicked than Judah to punish His own people."

Why are You silent while the wicked swallow up those more righteous than themselves?” He struggled to make sense of God’s plan. From a human perspective, it seemed unfair that the Babylonians, known for their cruelty and violence, would be used as instruments of judgment. Habakkuk described them as people who worshiped their own strength, who captured nations and treated people like fish caught in a net. It was hard for him to believe that God, who is holy and pure, could allow such evil to triumph. But instead of turning away from God, Habakkuk decided to wait and watch for God’s answer. He said he would stand at his watchtower and look to see what God would say to him."

God assured Habakkuk that the Babylonians, though powerful for a season, would also be judged for their arrogance, greed, and violence. Five “woes” were declared against them—condemning their oppression, bloodshed, idolatry, and pride. God made it clear that no one escapes His justice, and that His glory would one day fill the whole earth."

He described God’s majesty in poetic language, saying His splendor covered the heavens, the earth was full of His praise, and His power made the mountains tremble. As Habakkuk reflected on God’s faithfulness in history, his fear turned into faith. Even though he knew difficult times were coming—war, famine, and destruction—he decided to trust in God no matter what."

It teaches that faith is not just believing in God when everything is going well, but trusting Him even when nothing makes sense. Habakkuk began his journey full of doubt and fear, but he ended it full of peace and confidence in God’s power and goodness. His story encourages every believer to hold on to faith during dark and uncertain times, knowing that the Lord is in control, that He is faithful, and that He will make all things right in His perfect time."

God warned Judah that He would stretch out His hand against Jerusalem and against the inhabitants of the land because they had turned to Baal and other false gods, forgotten Him, and mixed true worship with idol worship.

It shows how deeply God loved His people, even when they had grown careless and disobedient. He called them to return to Him with sincere hearts, to worship Him properly, to be faithful in their relationships, and to honor Him with their offerings. Malachi also reminded them that God is just and that He sees everything. His message bridges the Old and New Testaments, pointing directly to the coming of Jesus Christ, the true Lord of the temple and the ultimate messenger of God’s covenant. Through Malachi, we learn that God desires not empty rituals but a faithful heart, and that He is always preparing His people for His coming and His eternal kingdom."

Elijah lived during a very dark time in Israel’s history, when King Ahab and his wife Jezebel led the people into idol worship, especially the worship of Baal. Elijah’s name means “My God is Yahweh,” and his life truly reflected that name because he stood boldly for the true God when almost everyone else had turned away."

Without any introduction, he goes to the king and declares that there will be no rain or dew in Israel for several years except by his word. This was a direct challenge to Baal, who was believed to control rain and fertility. After giving this message, God told Elijah to hide near the brook Cherith. There, Elijah was miraculously fed by ravens who brought him bread and meat every morning and evening. When the brook eventually dried up because of the drought, God sent him to a widow in Zarephath. This woman was very poor and had only a little flour and oil left, but Elijah told her that if she made him a small cake first, God would keep her flour and oil from running out until the famine ended. The widow trusted God’s word through Elijah, and the miracle happened just as Elijah said. Later, the widow’s son fell sick and died, but Elijah prayed earnestly to God, and God brought the boy back to life—the first recorded resurrection in the Bible."

Ahab blamed Elijah for the nation’s troubles, but Elijah replied that it was Ahab and his family who had caused it by worshiping Baal. To prove that Yahweh was the true God, Elijah challenged Ahab to bring the prophets of Baal to Mount Carmel for a public showdown. There, Elijah faced 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah. The challenge was simple—both sides would prepare a sacrifice, but they would not light the fire. The true God would answer by sending fire from heaven. From morning till evening, the prophets of Baal shouted, danced, and even cut themselves, but nothing happened. Then Elijah repaired the altar of the Lord using twelve stones, one for each tribe of Israel, and drenched the sacrifice and wood with water three times to show that it was not human trickery. Then he prayed a short but powerful prayer asking God to reveal Himself. Immediately, fire from heaven fell and burned up the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the dust, and even the water. The people fell on their faces and cried, “The Lord, He is God!” Elijah then ordered the prophets of Baal to be executed at the brook Kishon."

Soon the sky became dark, and heavy rain began to fall, ending the long drought. Elijah ran ahead of Ahab’s chariot all the way to Jezreel, strengthened by the power of God. But when Jezebel heard what had happened to her prophets, she swore to kill Elijah. Terrified, Elijah fled into the wilderness. He became so discouraged that he asked God to let him die. But God did not abandon him. An angel came and gave him food and water, saying, “The journey is too great for you.” Strengthened by that food, Elijah traveled forty days and nights to Mount Horeb (Mount Sinai). There, God revealed Himself not in wind, earthquake, or fire, but in a gentle whisper. God told Elijah to anoint Hazael as king of Aram, Jehu as king of Israel, and Elisha as the prophet to succeed him. God also comforted Elijah by saying that there were still seven thousand people in Israel who had not bowed to Baal."

Then Elijah asked Elisha what he wanted before he was taken away, and Elisha boldly asked for a “double portion” of Elijah’s spirit. Elijah said it was a hard request, but if Elisha saw him being taken up, it would be granted. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appeared, separating them, and Elijah was taken up into heaven by a whirlwind. Elisha saw it and cried out in sorrow, tearing his clothes. He then picked up Elijah’s cloak, struck the Jordan River as Elijah had done, and the waters parted again—showing that the same Spirit of God was now with him."

Miraculously, the oil kept flowing until every jar was filled. She sold the oil, paid her debts, and had enough to live on. Another time, a wealthy woman from Shunem, who often provided food and a room for Elisha, was blessed with a son through Elisha’s prophecy. Later, when the boy suddenly died, she ran to Elisha in grief. Elisha went to her house, prayed earnestly, and stretched himself over the child.

Naaman returned to Elisha and confessed that there was no God in all the world except in Israel.
