    "verse_1": "This letter is from me, Paul. I am a servant of Christ Jesus. God chose me to be his apostle. He sent me to tell his good news to people.",
    "verse_2": "God promised this good news long ago, before it became true. His prophets wrote about it in the Bible.",
    "verse_5": "Because of Jesus Christ, God has been very kind to us. He has chosen me to serve him as an apostle. He sent me to tell his message to people from all countries. As a result they would know that Jesus Christ is great. They would trust him and obey him.",
    "verse_6": "You Christians in Rome are also among those people! God has chosen you to belong to Jesus Christ.",
    "verse_7": "So I am writing to all you Christians who are in Rome. God loves you and he has chosen you to be his own people. I pray that God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ will continue to help you. I pray that they will give you peace in your minds.",
    "verse_8": "First, because of what Jesus Christ has done for us, I thank my God for all of you. Everywhere in the world, people are talking about how you trust in Jesus Christ.",
    "verse_9": "God is the one that I serve with all my spirit. I tell people the message about his Son, which is good news. God himself knows that I pray for you all the time.",
    "verse_10": "Every time that I pray for you, I ask God for a chance that I might visit you soon. I pray that he will make it possible if that is what he wants.",
    "verse_11": "I want very much to come and see you. Then I can give some gift from God's Spirit to you. That will help you to be strong as you serve God.",
    "verse_12": "We can help each other to be strong like that, because both you and I trust Christ.",
    "verse_13": "My Christian friends, I want you to know that I have tried often to visit you. But until now, something has always stopped me. I want to help you to serve God well, in the way that I have already helped other Gentiles.",
    "verse_14": "Because God has been kind to me, I must tell his message to all people. I must tell his good news to people who have learned many things, and to those who have never been to school. I must tell it to people who are wise as well as to those who are not very clever.",
    "verse_15": "Because of that, I want very much to tell God's good news also to you people who live in Rome.",
    "verse_16": "I am not ashamed to tell people the good news. God uses that good news to show his great power. He uses it to save all people who believe in Jesus Christ. First, God saves all Jews who are believers. And he also saves all Gentiles who are believers.",
    "verse_17": "The good news explains how God accepts people as right with himself. He does this when they believe in Christ. It is only because of their faith. Nothing else. This is what was written in the Bible long ago: ‘Everyone that God accepts as right will live, because they trust him.’",
    "verse_18": "God in heaven shows that he is angry with people. He is angry because they do not respect him and they do bad things. Because they continue to do those bad things, they choose not to accept God's true message.",
    "verse_19": "They should understand what God is like, because God himself has shown it to them clearly.",
    "verse_20": "Ever since God made the world, he has been showing people clearly about himself. We cannot see God. But the things that he has made show us clearly what he is like. We can understand his great power that continues for ever. We can know that he is the true God. So there is no reason for anyone to say, ‘We could not know about God.’",
    "verse_21": "Those people really knew about God. But they did not respect him as a great God, and they did not thank him. They did not even think clearly any more. Their minds became confused and they did not understand God's message.",
    "verse_22": "They said that they were wise, but really they became fools.",
    "verse_23": "They refused to worship the great God who can never die. Instead, they made false gods for themselves. They worshipped idols that were like people who must die. They also made idols that looked like birds, animals and snakes, and they worshipped them.",
    "verse_24": "So God let those people do all the bad things that they wanted to do. God let those disgusting things rule their lives. As a result, they did bad things with each other's bodies. They did things that people should be ashamed to do.",
    "verse_25": "They refused to believe the true things about God. Instead, they chose to believe lies. They worshipped things that God has made and they became servants of those things. But they refused to worship God himself who made those things! Everyone should praise him for ever! Amen. This is true.",
    "verse_26": "Because those people turned against God, he let those bad things rule their lives. They strongly wanted to do things that they should be ashamed about. Even the women stopped having sex in a way which is proper. Instead, they began to have sex with other women, which is not proper.",
    "verse_27": "Also, the men stopped having sex with women. Instead, they strongly wanted to have sex with other men. Men did bad things with other men that they should be ashamed about. Because they did such wrong things, they received in their own bodies the punishment that was right.",
    "verse_28": "Those people decided that they did not need to know anything about God. So God let their minds become spoiled. As a result, they do bad things that people ought not to do.",
    "verse_29": "They only think about wrong and bad things that they want to do. They want many things for themselves. They want to hurt other people. They are always jealous of other people. They kill people. They quarrel and fight with people. They are not honest or kind. They say silly things about other people.",
    "verse_30": "They tell lies about people. They hate God. They insult other people. They are proud and they say how important they are. They think of many ways to do bad things. They do not obey their parents.",
    "verse_31": "They do not understand what is right. They do not do what they have promised to do. They do not love anyone and they are not kind to anyone.",
    "verse_32": "These people understand God's message about what is right. They know that people who do bad things like this ought to die. But they still continue to do those bad things. They are even happy when other people do those bad things too."

  "chapter_2": {
    "verse_1": "So I say this to each one of you: Do not judge other people. If you decide that someone else has done a bad thing, remember that you also do the same bad things. You are really saying that God should punish you also! When you judge someone, God will not punish them and then forgive you.",
    "verse_2": "When God judges people, he does it in a way that is right and fair. He punishes people who do those kind of bad things.",
    "verse_3": "I ask each of you again: ‘Do you speak against people who do bad things, but you do those same bad things yourself?’ Then God will certainly punish you and you will not go free.",
    "verse_4": "Remember that God is very kind and patient with us. He waits a long time before he punishes us. Do you not think that that is important? You should understand that God is giving you a chance to change. He waits patiently, so that you may turn away from wrong things.",
    "verse_5": "But you refuse to change the way that you live. You are not sorry about the wrong things that you have done. As a result, you cause God to become even angrier with you. So he will punish you even more on the day when he will judge everyone. On that day, he will show how angry he is against people who do bad things. Everyone will know that he judges people in a right way.",
    "verse_6": "He will give to each person what they ought to have because of the things that they have done.",
    "verse_7": "Some people continue patiently to do good things. They want to do what is right so that God will praise them. They want to live the kind of life which death will not spoil. God will cause people like that to live with him always.",
    "verse_8": "But other people think only about themselves. They refuse to obey God's true message. Instead, they continue to do things that are wrong. God will be very angry with people like that and he will punish them.",
    "verse_9": "God will punish everyone who does bad things. He will do that first to the Jews, and he will do it also to the Gentiles. There will be much trouble and pain for every person who does bad things.",
    "verse_10": "But God will praise every person who does good things. He will make them great and they will have peace in their minds. He will do that first for the Jews, and he will do it also for the Gentiles.",
    "verse_11": "God is always fair when he judges people, whoever they are.",
    "verse_12": "The Gentiles do not have God's Law that he gave to Moses. If Gentiles do wrong things, God will punish them. But he will not use his Law when he judges the Gentiles. But the Jews do have God's Law. So, if Jews do wrong things, God will use his Law to judge them. The Law will show that they have done wrong things.",
    "verse_13": "Who does God accept as right with himself? It is those people who obey his Law. It is not the people who only know his Law but do not obey them.",
    "verse_14": "The Gentiles do not have God's Law. But they may still do the right things that the Law teaches. They do right things because of what they themselves think is right. In that way they are showing that they have a certain law in their minds, even though they do not know God's Law.",
    "verse_15": "Those people show that they know what is right. It is as if God has written his Law deep inside them. Their thoughts tell them the difference between what is right and what is wrong. Sometimes their thoughts say: ‘You did something that is wrong.’ And sometimes their thoughts say: ‘You did what is right.’",
    "verse_16": "That is the message that I tell people. God knows everything that people think secretly. One day he will judge everyone. He has given Jesus Christ the authority to do that.",
    "verse_17": "Do you say that you are a Jew? Maybe you trust in the Law that God gave to Moses. You are proud that you belong to God.",
    "verse_18": "You know what God wants people to do. His Law teaches you what is good and right.",
    "verse_19": "You are sure that you yourself can teach other people about God. You think that you can be like a guide to blind people. You think that you can be like a light to people who are in the dark.",
    "verse_20": "You are sure that you can teach fools and people who do not know very much. You know that God's Law tells you everything about what is true. Because it helps you to know so much, you think that you can be a great teacher!",
    "verse_21": "So you teach other people, do you? But do you teach yourself? You tell other people, ‘Do not rob anyone.’ But maybe you yourself rob other people.",
    "verse_22": "You say, ‘People must not have sex with anyone who is not their wife or their husband.’ But maybe you yourself have sex in a wrong way. You say that you hate idols. But do you rob places where people worship idols?",
    "verse_23": "You are proud that you know God's Law. But you do not obey that Law. As a result, you cause other people to speak against God.",
    "verse_24": "This is written in the Bible: ‘Because of you Jews, the Gentiles say bad things against God.’",
    "verse_25": "As a Jewish man, you are proud that someone has circumcised you. That is a help to you, if you obey God's Law in your life. But if you do not obey God's Law, then it is worth nothing. You have become like a Gentile that nobody has ever circumcised.",
    "verse_26": "But a Gentile may obey what God's Law teaches. Then he has shown that he belongs to God even though nobody has circumcised him.",
    "verse_27": "In that way, even Gentiles will show that you who are Jews are wrong. God's Law was written to help you Jews. They circumcised you to show that you belong to God. But if you refuse to obey God's Law, then God will punish you. The Gentiles who do obey God's Law will show that God is right to punish you.",
    "verse_28": "Not everyone who seems to be a Jew is really a Jew who belongs to God. God does not accept a man just because someone has circumcised that man's body.",
    "verse_29": "No! A true Jew is someone who belongs to God in his spirit. He belongs to God because God's Spirit has changed his life. It is like God has circumcised him in his spirit, not in his body. The rules in God's Law cannot do that work in a person. Other people may not praise a person like that, but God will praise him."
  },
  "chapter_3": {
    "verse_1": "So someone may ask, ‘Does it help a person if they are a Jew, rather than a Gentile? Does it help a person if someone has circumcised them?’",
    "verse_2": "Yes, it helps in many ways. The first is that God chose to give his messages to the Jewish people.",
    "verse_3": "But you may say, ‘Some Jews did not believe God's messages as they should have done. Because of that, maybe God will not do what he said he would do.’",
    "verse_4": "No, certainly it does not mean that! God will always do what he says. He will always say what is true, even if everyone in the world should tell lies. This is what is written in the Bible: ‘Your message is true. It shows that you are right. People may say that you are wrong. But it will always be clear that you are right.’",
    "verse_5": "Maybe some people may say, ‘The wrong things that we do show more clearly that God is always right. So perhaps God is wrong to punish us.’",
    "verse_6": "That is not true! God always decides what is right and fair. That is why he is able to judge everyone in the world.",
    "verse_7": "Someone might also say, ‘When I tell lies, that shows how great and good God is. My lies show more clearly that God always says what is true. So God should not say that I am a bad person. He should not punish me.’",
    "verse_8": "But if that is true, you could also say, ‘We should do more and more bad things. Then something good will happen as a result.’ Some people even say that is the message which I teach. But if they say that, they are insulting me. It is right that God should punish those people.",
    "verse_9": "So then, what do we learn from that? We cannot say that we Jews are better than other people. No, certainly we cannot say that! I have said already that sin has power over everyone. That is true for both Jews and Gentiles.",
    "verse_10": "This is written in the Bible: ‘There is nobody who is right with God. There is not even one person who is like that.",
    "verse_11": "There is nobody who understands what is true. There is nobody who wants to worship God.",
    "verse_12": "Everyone has turned away from God. All people have become completely bad. Nobody does what is good or kind. There is not even one person who is like that.",
    "verse_13": "Bad words come out of their mouth, like a very bad smell. They tell lies all the time, so that people do wrong things. The things that they say hurt people, like a snake's poison.",
    "verse_14": "They are always saying bad things against people, because they want to cause trouble for them.",
    "verse_15": "They hurry to kill people.",
    "verse_16": "Everywhere they go, they destroy things. They only make people very sad.",
    "verse_17": "They have never known how to live in peace.",
    "verse_18": "They refuse to respect God in any way.’",
    "verse_19": "So, we know that God's Law belongs to the Jews. God told them to obey everything that his Law teaches. As a result, nobody can say: ‘God should not punish me.’ Everybody in the world must stand in front of God and he will judge them.",
    "verse_20": "God's Law shows people clearly that they have done wrong things. Nobody can become right with God because they obey that Law.",
    "verse_21": "But now we know how to become right with God. God has shown us the way that he will accept people as right with himself. This way is not part of the Law that he gave to Moses. But God's Law and the messages of his prophets have told us about it.",
    "verse_22": "God accepts people as right with himself because Jesus Christ did what God wanted. God accepts every person who believes in Christ. It is the same way for everyone, whether they are Jews or Gentiles.",
    "verse_23": "All people have done wrong things. Nobody can be good and great, as God wanted them to be.",
    "verse_24": "But because God is very kind, he accepts us as right with himself. That is God's gift to us. Jesus Christ has paid for our sins so that we have become free.",
    "verse_25": "God showed everyone that Jesus Christ died on the cross as a sacrifice for our sins. God forgives us if we trust in Jesus and the blood of his sacrifice. God did this to show clearly that he is always right and fair. In past times, God was patient. He did not punish people who did wrong things.",
    "verse_26": "He did this to show us today that he is completely right and fair. He accepts people as right with himself if they believe in Jesus.",
    "verse_27": "So then, nobody should be proud that they are good enough. Nobody becomes right with God because they have done good things. No! God accepts a person only if that person believes in Jesus Christ.",
    "verse_28": "So this is what we are saying. A person becomes right with God if they trust in Christ. It is not because they do the good things which God's Law teaches.",
    "verse_29": "God is not God only for Jewish people. He is also God for the Gentiles. Yes! He is the God for all people.",
    "verse_30": "There is only one God. He will accept Jews as right with himself if they believe in Christ. He will also accept other people as right with himself if they believe in Christ.",
    "verse_31": "What does this show us about God's Law which he gave to Moses? When we say that all people need to believe in Jesus, does that mean that God's Law has no purpose? No! When we believe in Jesus, we are showing the true purpose of God's Law."

  "chapter_4": {
    "verse_1": "Abraham was the ancestor of all of us who are Jews. Think about what he discovered.",
    "verse_2": "God did not accept Abraham as right with him because Abraham had done good things. If God had done that, then Abraham would have been able to boast about himself. But he could not boast to God.",
    "verse_3": "Remember what the Bible tells us. It says: ‘Abraham believed God. As a result, God accepted Abraham as right with him.’",
    "verse_4": "When a person works to get money, it is right for him to receive his money. That money is not a gift. It is what that person ought to receive as a result of his work.",
    "verse_5": "But someone may believe in God. He does not work to cause God to accept him. God accepts that person because of their faith. God says that people who have turned away from him are right with him, if they trust him. That is God's gift to them.",
    "verse_6": "David also wrote about the same thing. He describes those people that God has accepted as right with himself. God has not accepted them because they have done good things, but as his gift to them. David tells us how happy people like that are.",
    "verse_7": "David says: ‘The people that God has forgiven are really happy. They have done wrong things, but he has forgiven them.",
    "verse_8": "A person is really happy when the Lord accepts him. The Lord does not think about that person's sin any more.’",
    "verse_9": "God does this for all people, both Jews and Gentiles. All people can be really happy like this, when God accepts them. As we have said, Abraham believed God. As a result, God accepted Abraham as right with him.",
    "verse_10": "They circumcised Abraham to show that he was a Jew. Think about the time when God accepted Abraham. Did it happen before they circumcised him, or after that? We know that it was before they circumcised him!",
    "verse_11": "Some time after that, God told Abraham that someone should circumcise him. That would be a mark on his body to show that God had accepted him. God had already accepted Abraham because Abraham believed in him. God did not accept Abraham because they had circumcised him as a Jewish man. This shows that Abraham is like a father to everyone that God has accepted. Like Abraham, God has accepted them because they have believed in him. It is not important that nobody has circumcised them.",
    "verse_12": "But Abraham is also like the father of all Jews who believe in God. Someone has circumcised those Jews, but they have copied Abraham's example. They have believed in God, as Abraham believed before anyone had circumcised him.",
    "verse_13": "God promised to Abraham, and to his descendants, that the world would belong to them one day. God did not promise that because Abraham obeyed any rules. God promised it because Abraham believed in him. That is why God accepted Abraham as right with him.",
    "verse_14": "People cannot get what God promised because they obey rules. If they could get it like that, then faith in God would be worth nothing. And what God promised would be worth nothing.",
    "verse_15": "The rules in Moses' Law say that God will punish people who do not obey those rules. But without any rules, there is nothing for people to obey.",
    "verse_16": "So God gives us his promise as a gift, because he is very kind. We receive it when we trust him. If we believe in God like Abraham did, then God accepts us. That is God's promise to all of Abraham's family. If we believe in God, we can call Abraham our ancestor. We can all receive what God has promised. It is not only for those who have Moses' Law to obey.",
    "verse_17": "In the Bible, God said to Abraham, ‘I have chosen you to become the ancestor of many different people.’ That is what God himself promises, because Abraham believed in him. God is the one who causes dead people to become alive again. He speaks about things that are not yet there as if they were already there.",
    "verse_18": "Abraham continued to trust God. He hoped to receive what God had promised. He continued to hope even when he had no good reason to hope. That is why he became the ancestor of many different people. It happened just like God had said: ‘You will have very many descendants.’",
    "verse_19": "Abraham was about 100 years old. His body was already so old that it was nearly dead. His wife, Sarah, was unable to have children. Abraham understood all that, but he did not stop trusting God.",
    "verse_20": "He never stopped believing what God had promised. Instead, he believed in God more strongly. He trusted God's great power.",
    "verse_21": "Abraham was sure that God was able to do what he had promised to do.",
    "verse_22": "So we see that it is true: Because Abraham believed God, God accepted Abraham as right with him.",
    "verse_23": "Think about those words, ‘God accepted him as right.’ They are not only speaking about Abraham.",
    "verse_24": "They are written in the Bible to help us too. If we believe in God, he will accept us as right with him. God raised our Lord Jesus, so that he became alive again after his death.",

    "verse_3": "We are happy even when we have troubles and pain. That is because we know that those troubles help us to become patient and strong.",
    "verse_4": "And when we remain strong, we show that we trust God. When we trust God like that, it causes us to hope for God's help.",
    "verse_5": "And when we hope like that, it will not disappoint us. That is because we know that God loves us very much. God has given his Holy Spirit to be with us. The Holy Spirit causes us to know God's love very well.",
    "verse_6": "At one time we were weak and we could not help ourselves. Then, at the right time, Christ died to save us. He died on behalf of people who have turned away from God.",
    "verse_7": "Nobody will agree to die on behalf of another person, even if that person has done what is right. Maybe someone might be brave enough to die on behalf of a person who is very good.",
    "verse_8": "But God has shown us how much he loves us. Even when we still did not obey God, Christ died on our behalf.",
    "verse_9": "Because Christ died on the cross, God has accepted us as right with himself. So we certainly know that Christ will save us when God judges everyone. Because of Jesus, God will not be angry with us and punish us.",
    "verse_10": "While we were still God's enemies, God's Son died on our behalf. As a result, we became God's friends. So, now that we are God's friends, his Son will certainly save us. Christ will save us because he is alive again.",
    "verse_11": "But that is not everything! We are very happy now because of what God has done for us. Our Lord Jesus Christ has made this possible. It is because of him that we have now become God's friends.",
    "verse_12": "It was because of one man, Adam, that sin came into the world. Death was the result of Adam's sin. Because of that, death came to all people, because everyone failed to obey God.",
    "verse_13": "Before God gave his Law to Moses, people did wrong things. Sin was already there in the world. But at that time, God did not say that people were guilty, because there was no law for them to obey.",
    "verse_14": "But still death ruled all people, from the time when Adam lived until the time when Moses lived. Everyone died, even those who did not fail in the same way that Adam failed. Adam shows us something about God's special Messiah who would come at a future time.",
    "verse_15": "But they are not the same. Adam was the man who did not obey what God said to him. Jesus Christ is the man who brought God's free gift to people. Adam was just one person but many people died because of his sin. But God has shown in a greater way that he is very kind to people. Very many people have received God's gift because of one man, Jesus Christ. Christ has been very kind to many people!",
    "verse_16": "Also, God's gift is different from the result of Adam's sin. Adam chose not to obey God once and punishment came as a result. But the result of God's gift is greater. People have done many wrong things, not only one wrong thing. But God accepts them as right with him.",
    "verse_17": "One man, Adam, did not obey God, and death began to rule everyone as a result. But what the one man, Jesus Christ, did is much greater! Because of him, people can become right with God. They receive that great gift from God because he is very good and very kind. Because of what Jesus Christ has done, those people will rule like kings in their lives.",
    "verse_18": "So God's punishment came to all people because of that one wrong thing that Adam did. But the one thing that Christ did makes people free. God accepts all people because of that one good thing that Christ did. Those people receive true life from God.",
    "verse_19": "One man did not obey God and, as a result, many people became guilty because of their sins. But, because one man did obey God, many people will become right with God.",
    "verse_20": "God gave his Law to Moses to show more clearly that people were doing wrong things. But when people did more and more wrong things, God continued to be kind in more and more ways.",
    "verse_21": "We see that sin ruled people's lives and brought death to them. But God's gift makes people right with him, and that is what rules their lives. People receive that gift because God is kind. As a result, they will have life with God for ever, because of what our Lord Jesus Christ has done."

  "chapter_6": {
    "verse_1": "Someone might say, ‘Perhaps we should continue to do wrong things. Then God can be kind to us in more and more ways.’",
    "verse_2": "No! Certainly we should not do that! Sin does not rule our lives any longer. That old life is dead! So it is not right that we should continue to do wrong things.",
    "verse_3": "Remember what your baptism shows: When they baptized you, it shows that you are united with Christ Jesus. It also shows that, because Christ died, your old life also died.",
    "verse_4": "Your baptism shows that they buried you, just like they buried Christ after his death. It is like you died with him and they buried you with him. Because of that, God will also raise us, just as he raised Christ from death. God, the Father, is so great and powerful that he raised Christ to a new life. That means that we also can live our lives in a new way.",
    "verse_5": "We have become united with Christ, and we have died like he died. Because of that, we will also be united with him in his new life. Just like Christ rose, we also will rise to a new life.",
    "verse_6": "We know that God has caused our old nature to die with Christ on the cross. This happened so that God could make us free from the power of sin in our lives. We are no longer like slaves who have sin as their master.",
    "verse_7": "Sin no longer has any authority over someone who has died.",
    "verse_8": "So, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.",
    "verse_9": "God raised Christ, so that he became alive again after his death. Because of that, we know that he will never die again. Death has no authority over him any more.",
    "verse_10": "When Christ died, he died once to destroy the power of sin for ever. Now that he is alive again, he lives to serve God.",
    "verse_11": "So you also should think about yourselves in the same way. Sin has no power over you, as if you were dead. In your new life, you live to serve God, because you belong to Christ Jesus.",

At one time, you agreed to serve bad things as your master. You let your body do wrong and disgusting things. You continued to do more and more bad things. So now, you must use your body to serve what is right and good. Then you will do more and more good things which show that you belong to God.",

    "verse_3": "While her husband is alive, the law has authority over her. If she goes to live with another man, the law says that she has done something wrong. People will call her an adulteress. But if her husband dies, she becomes free from that law. If she then marries another man, she will not be doing anything wrong.",
    "verse_4": "My friends, it is like that for you too. When Christ's body died on the cross, it is as if you also died with him. Because of that, you are no longer under the authority the law. Now you are free to belong to someone else. You belong to Christ, whom God raised up after his death. As a result, we can live in a good way that will please God.",
    "verse_5": "In our old lives, we did the bad things that we wanted to do. God's laws brought bad thoughts into our minds. As a result, our bodies did many wrong things. In the end, those bad things lead to death.",
    "verse_6": "But now we have become free from the authority of the law. It is as if we have died. So those rules no longer control us. We do not still try to obey rules that someone has written down. That is the old way. Instead, we serve God in a new way. God's Spirit helps us to please him.",
    "verse_7": "So someone might say, ‘God's Law must be bad.’ No! Certainly, it is not bad! Without that law, I would not have known what sin really is. One rule says, ‘You must not want to take things for yourself that belong to other people.’ Without that command, I would not have known that it is wrong to want other people's things.",
    "verse_8": "But the command gave sin a chance to come into my thoughts. As a result, I started to want all kinds of wrong things. If there is no law to tell us what is wrong, then sin has no power to make us guilty.",
    "verse_9": "As for me, there was a time when I did not know God's laws. I was living without any law to obey. But when I learned about that command, sin now had power in my life.",

    "verse_13": "But someone might say, ‘This means that something good brought death to you.’ No! God's Law did not do that! It was sin that brought death to me. Sin used God's good Law to show that I was guilty. Because of that, we can see that sin is really very bad. The commands in God's Law help to show that sin is completely bad.",

    "verse_25": "My Christian friends, I want to help you to understand about Israel's people. It is a secret that God has shown to us.

They will continue to refuse him until the complete number of Gentiles have believed.",
