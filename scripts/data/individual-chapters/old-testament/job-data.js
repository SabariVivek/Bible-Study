            text: "Job was a successful man. He was rich. And he was important. Everybody respected Job, because Job was wealthy.\n\nJob did deserve honour, but not because of his wealth. Job deserved honour because he respected God. Job always tried to do the right things. And Job refused to do evil things.\n\nJob did not pretend that he was perfect (Job 31:33). Everybody does some evil deeds (Romans 3:23). This is why Jesus died for us (Romans 3:24-25). Jesus suffered the punishment for our evil deeds. We should invite God into our lives. Nobody on earth is perfect. But, if we trust God, God will make us perfect in heaven (1 Corinthians 13:12).\n\nJob did trust God. Job was sincere. Job’s attitudes (Job 31) prove this. Even God spoke well about Job (verse 8).\n\nIn Ezekiel 14:14, God mentions Job. God also mentions Noah and Daniel in this passage. Here, God explains that the people in some countries are very wicked. God will punish these people severely. Even a good man like Job could not save such people. And even Noah and Daniel could not help them. This passage in Ezekiel shows us that God really considered Job a good man."

They were greedy. They drank plenty of wine. They did not think that Job’s religion was important.\n\nLater, in Job 8:4, Bildad said that Job’s children were evil. Job agreed with Bildad – see Job 9:2."

            text: "Job prayed for his children. Before Jesus died, holy people often killed animals as a gift to God. The Bible taught the people to do this (Leviticus chapters 1-7). The people knew that an animal cannot take the punishment for our evil deeds (Psalm 51:16). They knew that only God can forgive us (Psalm 51:17). But the death of an animal reminded them that evil deeds are serious matters. And this tradition taught them that Jesus would die for us all (Genesis 22:8 and John 1:29).\n\nJob was afraid that his children would insult God. This would be terrible because we must always respect God. God created us. And God is our judge. In fact, the author of the Book of Job did not even want to write the words: ‘insult God’. In the language called Hebrew, he wrote the words: ‘praise God’. He did not mean ‘praise’ because of course we should praise God. But the author knew that his readers would be able to work out the meaning of his words."

            text: "The book of Job teaches us many things about the devil. The devil’s name is Satan. ‘Satan’ means ‘the accuser’.\n\nJob’s friends did not blame Satan for Job’s troubles. Even Job did not blame the devil. Job and his friends thought that God made Job suffer. But they were wrong. God is good. God wants us to have wonderful lives. God is preparing a beautiful home in heaven for his people (John 14:1-3; Revelation chapter 21).\n\nThe Book of Job explains that Satan caused Job’s troubles. Many Christians think that Satan was once an angel (a servant of God) – Isaiah 14:12-15. But Satan refused to obey God. Satan thought that he would be as great as God. Other angels joined Satan. These evil angels are called ‘evil spirits’. (See Mark 5:1-20.)\n\nSatan causes the troubles in the world. God created a beautiful world (Genesis 2:8). But Satan used a snake to test the first people (Genesis 3). The snake told the first people that they should not obey God. Then they would become like God (Genesis 3:3-5). The people obeyed this terrible advice. Since then, everybody has done evil deeds. This is why our lives are difficult (Genesis 3:17-19).\n\nSatan even tested Jesus (Matthew 4:1-11; Hebrews 4:15). But Jesus did not behave like us. Jesus did nothing that was evil (1 Peter 1:19; Hebrews 7:26-28). When Jesus died, he destroyed Satan’s work (Genesis 3:15; Hebrews 2:14). When we invite God into our lives, we become friends of God, because of Jesus’ death (Ephesians 2:14-18).\n\nBut the devil continues to test us. He wanders across the world (1 Peter 4:8). He tries to tempt us. He wants to accuse us. We must not follow his advice (James 4:7). He hates us because we love God. And God will protect us (Ephesians 6:10-18).\n\nIn the Book of Job, Satan visited heaven. We do not expect to see the devil in heaven! The devil is God’s enemy. The devil belongs in hell.\n\nJesus’ work was complete when Jesus died for us (Hebrews 10:13-14). But God’s enemies still have some power (Luke 4:6; 1 Corinthians 15:26; Hebrews 10:13). In the future, God will punish all his enemies. And Satan will suffer the punishment that he deserves (Revelation 20:1-10)."

He sees our secret actions (Matthew 6:3-4). He hears our quiet prayers (Matthew 5:6). He is better than a friend (John 15:15). He is closer than a brother (Proverbs 18:24). God loves his people.

God was protecting Job so Satan could not attack Job!\n\nSatan was wrong to argue that God is not fair. God is always fair.\n\nBut Satan was right that God protects his people. God rescues us when we have troubles (Psalm 40:1–3). God saves us from our enemies (Psalm 59). God helps us when we pray (Psalm 61). God is like a castle where we are safe (Psalm 61:1–2). We can always trust God (Psalm 71)."

            text: "In verse 11, Satan wanted God to destroy Job’s property. But God did not agree to this request. God is not evil. God does not do terrible things to his people. God is never cruel. God refused to destroy Job’s property.\n\nHowever, sometimes God allows the devil to test us. God allows such troubles so that we learn to trust God more (1 Peter 1:7). Even when we suffer, we love God deeply. And God gives joy to us (1 Peter 1:8).\n\nTerrible things might happen to us (Matthew 5:11). But we can be glad. God has a wonderful reward for us in heaven (Matthew 5:12). Stephen knew this. Stephen’s enemies killed him because he spoke boldly about Jesus. But when Stephen was dying, he did not care about his pain. God showed heaven to Stephen. Stephen even saw Jesus in heaven (Acts 7:55). So Stephen was not afraid (Acts 7:59-60). He knew that God would reward him. And Stephen knew that heaven was his real home. (See 1 Peter 1:4.)\n\nWe must not be afraid of troubles. God knows us. And he cares about us. God decided what troubles Job would suffer. In verse 12, God did not allow Satan to hurt Job. In Job 2:6, God did not allow Satan to kill Job. Satan might cause many troubles, but God controls our lives.\n\nWe can trust God. He will not allow us to suffer troubles that are too difficult for us. And God will help us when we have troubles. See 1 Corinthians 10:13. We are not alone when we suffer troubles. God will help us. God will make us strong. We do not need to be afraid. Paul suffered many troubles (2 Corinthians 11:23-33). But he wrote that these troubles were slight. He knew that God is preparing a wonderful reward for us in heaven (Romans 8:18). So Paul was always glad (Philippians 4:4)."

Job’s troubles came suddenly.\n\nJob’s children were not ready for that day. They were behaving quite as they always behaved. They were not trusting God. They were not ready to meet God. Instead, they were ‘eating and drinking’.\n\nBefore Noah’s flood, people were ‘eating and drinking’. These people were not ready for the flood. The flood drowned them. And they were not ready to meet God (Matthew 24:37-39). People will also behave in this manner before Jesus returns. We must not behave like this. We must always be ready to meet God (Matthew 24:44). So we must invite God into our lives. And God will teach us to live in a way that pleases him."

Other enemies took Job’s oxen (farm animals) and his donkeys (small horses). In the morning, Job was the wealthiest man in the east. But in the evening, Job was a very poor man.\n\nSometimes troubles happen suddenly. Each new trouble makes us weaker. We think that we have no strength. But then, a worse trouble comes. Jeremiah knew this. When Jeremiah’s enemies attacked Jerusalem, the people in Jerusalem suffered terribly. The enemies destroyed the city. They killed many people. They took other people to be their slaves. But Jeremiah still remembered God’s love. Jeremiah still knew that God is kind. So, Jeremiah was patient. And Jeremiah knew that God would still answer prayer (Lamentations 3:22-24).\n\nHabakkuk wrote about this. Habakkuk could still feel joy even if his crops failed. He was glad because God would protect him. He was happy because God gave strength to him (Habakkuk 3:17-19)."

Job’s daughters died. His servants died. Only the four servants in Job 1:14-19 were still alive. Satan was very cruel to Job. Job did not realise that Satan caused Job’s troubles.

So Job’s reaction was important to Satan.\n\nJob’s reaction was also important to God. God was proud of Job (verse 8). God said that Job was God’s ‘servant’. Like a servant, Job did God’s work on earth (Job 31:16-23). As Christians, we are also God’s servants (Romans 1:1; Philippians 1:1; James 1:1; 2 Peter 1:1). God has given great responsibility to us (2 Corinthians 5:20). So, when we have troubles, God wants us to behave wisely.\n\nJob suffered very terrible troubles. We would not be surprised if Job was angry. We should have sympathy when people suffer.\n\nJob was very sad. He carried out the traditions of his people. The sad news upset him greatly. But Job was not angry with God. Instead, Job praised God.\n\nIn one day, Job lost everything that he owned. But Job still praised God.\n\nOn that day, Job’s sons and daughters died. But Job still praised God.\n\nJob had been rich. Now he was poor. But Job still praised God."

Job did not say that God was evil. Job continued to praise God.\n\nJob was patient (James 4:11). Job did not know why these terrible events happened. But Job trusted God. Job continued to praise God. Job was still a servant of God. So Job was careful always to respect God.\n\nPerhaps Job supposed that the most terrible things had happened to him. But soon he would suffer even more troubles.\n\nWe can learn many important lessons from Chapter 1:\n·   God is good. He protects us. He provides for us.\n·    The devil is cruel. The devil causes our troubles.\n·    Sometimes God allows the devil to test us. At these times, God is still protecting us. God will help us.\n\nWhen we have troubles, we should still trust God. We should continue to respect God. And we should praise God in every situation."
