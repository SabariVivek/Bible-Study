        heading: "King Ahab – The Wicked King Who Challenged God",
        text: "King Ahab was one of the most wicked kings of Israel. He ruled the northern kingdom for 22 years, and his story is mainly told in 1 Kings 16–22 and 2 Chronicles 18. He was the son of King Omri, who had already led Israel into idol worship, but Ahab went even further in evil than any king before him. His reign was marked by idolatry, corruption, and open rebellion against God, yet it was also a time when God showed great patience and mercy, sending prophets like Elijah to call him back."

        heading: "Ahab and Queen Jezebel",
        text: "Ahab ruled from the capital city Samaria, and his wife was the infamous Queen Jezebel, the daughter of Ethbaal, the king of Sidon, who was a worshipper of Baal, the Canaanite god of fertility and rain. This marriage was not only political but also spiritual corruption for Israel. Through Jezebel’s influence, Ahab began to worship Baal and build temples and altars for him in Samaria. He even made a wooden image of Asherah, another false goddess."

        heading: "Provoking the Lord",
        text: "The Bible says clearly, “Ahab did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him.” He not only turned his heart away from God but also led the whole nation into sin. Jezebel, who was very powerful and manipulative, began to kill the prophets of the Lord, and she surrounded herself with 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of Asherah."

        heading: "Elijah the Prophet",
        text: "In the middle of this dark time, God raised up a bold and powerful prophet named Elijah the Tishbite, from the region of Gilead. Elijah was not afraid to confront kings. He came before Ahab and said, “As the Lord God of Israel lives, there will be neither dew nor rain in the land except at my word.” With that, a severe drought began across Israel, which lasted for three and a half years."

        heading: "God’s Power Over Baal",
        text: "This drought was a direct challenge to Baal, who was believed to control rain and fertility. God was showing Israel that Baal was powerless and that He alone was the true God. During the drought, Elijah hid by the brook Cherith, where ravens brought him food every morning and evening. Later, when the brook dried up, God sent him to Zarephath, where a poor widow miraculously provided for him, and her jar of flour and jug of oil never ran out until the rain returned."

        heading: "Elijah Returns and Mount Carmel Challenge",
        text: "After three years, God told Elijah to return to Ahab and announce that rain would come again. Elijah met Obadiah, a godly man who worked in Ahab’s palace and had secretly hidden 100 prophets of the Lord from Jezebel. Obadiah arranged a meeting between Elijah and Ahab. When Ahab saw Elijah, he said, “Is that you, you troubler of Israel?” Elijah boldly replied, “I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father’s house have, because you have forsaken the Lord and followed Baal.” Then Elijah proposed a great contest on Mount Carmel to show who the true God was. He called together all Israel, the 450 prophets of Baal, and the 400 prophets of Asherah."

        heading: "The Contest on Mount Carmel",
        text: "Before everyone, Elijah said, “How long will you waver between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow Him; but if Baal is god, follow him.” The people were silent. Elijah then told the prophets of Baal to prepare a bull for sacrifice and place it on the altar but not to light the fire. He would do the same, and they would call upon their gods. The one who answered by fire would be the true God. The prophets of Baal began in the morning, calling on their god. They shouted, “O Baal, answer us!” but there was no voice, no reply. They danced wildly around the altar and even cut themselves with knives and swords until blood flowed, but still there was no response. Around noon, Elijah began to mock them, saying, “Shout louder! Maybe your god is deep in thought, or busy, or traveling, or sleeping and must be awakened!”"

        text: "Finally, when it was Elijah’s turn, he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been broken down. He took twelve stones, one for each tribe of Israel, built an altar in the name of the Lord, and dug a trench around it. He placed the wood and the bull on the altar, then poured twelve jars of water over it until everything was drenched and the trench was full of water. Then Elijah prayed, “Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that You are God in Israel, that I am Your servant, and that I have done all these things at Your command.” Immediately, fire from heaven fell and burned the sacrifice, the wood, the stones, the soil, and even the water in the trench. The people fell on their faces and cried out, “The Lord, He is God! The Lord, He is God!” Elijah then commanded the people to seize the prophets of Baal, and they were all killed by the brook Kishon. After this, Elijah prayed for rain, and soon, dark clouds gathered and a heavy rain fell on the land after years of drought."

        text: "When Jezebel heard that her prophets had been killed, she was furious. She swore to kill Elijah, so Elijah fled into the wilderness, discouraged and afraid. Yet even then, God took care of him. He sent an angel to feed him, and Elijah traveled for forty days and nights to Mount Horeb, where God spoke to him not in a storm or fire but in a gentle whisper."

        heading: "The Murder of Naboth",
        text: "Meanwhile, Ahab continued his evil ways. One of his most terrible acts was the murder of Naboth, a righteous man who owned a vineyard near Ahab’s palace in Jezreel. Ahab wanted Naboth’s vineyard to make it his garden, but Naboth refused, saying it was his ancestral inheritance. Ahab went home angry and refused to eat. Jezebel mocked him for being weak and said, “Are you not the king of Israel? Get up and eat; I will get you the vineyard.” Jezebel wrote letters in Ahab’s name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders of Naboth’s city. She ordered them to falsely accuse Naboth of blasphemy against God and the king. Naboth was stoned to death, and Ahab took possession of his vineyard."

        heading: "God’s Prophecy Against Ahab and Jezebel",
        text: "Then God sent Elijah again to confront Ahab. When Ahab came to the vineyard, Elijah met him and said, “Have you murdered and also taken possession? In the place where dogs licked Naboth’s blood, dogs will lick your blood also.” He also gave a prophecy against Jezebel: “The dogs will eat Jezebel by the wall of Jezreel.” God declared that Ahab’s whole family would be destroyed, just like the families of Jeroboam and Baasha. When Ahab heard these words, something unusual happened. He tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, fasted, and humbled himself before God. Because Ahab showed a sign of repentance, God told Elijah, “I will not bring the disaster in his days, but in his son’s days I will bring it upon his house.”"

        heading: "Ahab’s Death in Battle",
        text: "However, Ahab’s repentance was shallow, and soon he returned to his old ways. He allied himself with Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, to fight against Syria (Aram) to reclaim the city of Ramoth Gilead. Before going to war, Jehoshaphat asked that they inquire of the Lord. Ahab brought 400 prophets, but they all falsely said, “Go and fight; the Lord will give it into your hands.” Jehoshaphat, sensing something was wrong, asked, “Is there no prophet of the Lord here?” Ahab reluctantly mentioned Micaiah, saying, “There is one more, but I hate him because he never prophesies good about me.” Micaiah was called, and though he first mocked the king, he finally declared the truth: “I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd.” He warned that if Ahab went to battle, he would not return alive. Ahab ignored the warning. He disguised himself in battle while Jehoshaphat wore his royal robes. The enemy soldiers mistook Jehoshaphat for Ahab, but when they realized it was not him, they turned away. Then, a random arrow struck Ahab between the joints of his armor. Though he tried to stay upright in his chariot, bleeding heavily, he died by evening. His chariot was washed in the pool of Samaria, and dogs licked his blood, just as Elijah had prophesied."
