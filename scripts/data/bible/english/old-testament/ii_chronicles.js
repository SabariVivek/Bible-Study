They have not done the things that this book tells us that we should do.’",
    "verse_22": "So Hilkiah and the other men that the king had sent went to speak to Huldah. Huldah was a prophetess who lived in the north part of Jerusalem.

You did that when you heard how I would punish this place and the people who live here. Because you became so upset, I have heard your prayer.",
    "verse_28": "So I will let you die in peace and people will bury you beside your ancestors. You yourself will never see the great trouble that I will bring to this place and the people who live here.” That is what the Lord says.’ The men took Huldah's answer back to the king.",

    "verse_30": "He went up to the Lord's temple.  All the people who lived in Jerusalem and in the rest of Judah went with him. They included the priests, the Levites, young people and old people. Everyone went to the temple. They all listened while the king read to them all the words in the book of God's covenant. That was the book that Hilkiah had found in the Lord's temple.",
    "verse_32": "The king told all the people who were in Jerusalem and the people of Benjamin's tribe to stand. He told them to promise to obey God's laws. So the people who lived in Jerusalem agreed to obey the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors.",
