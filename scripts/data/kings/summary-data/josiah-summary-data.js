        heading: "King Josiah – The Boy King Who Brought Revival to Judah",
        text: "King Josiah was one of the most righteous and godly kings of Judah, remembered for his great reforms, pure heart, and love for God’s Word. He ruled in Jerusalem for 31 years, beginning at just 8 years old, after the death of his father, King Amon. His story is told in 2 Kings 22–23 and 2 Chronicles 34–35. Even though his father and grandfather had been very wicked, Josiah chose a completely different path — he turned his heart fully to God and led the entire nation back to true worship."

        heading: "Josiah’s Family Background",
        text: "Josiah was the son of King Amon and the grandson of King Manasseh. Both of them had done evil in the sight of the Lord. Manasseh had filled Jerusalem with idols, witchcraft, and even innocent blood, and Amon had continued in the same wicked ways. Because of this, Judah had become very sinful and corrupt. But when Josiah became king, something beautiful happened — even though he was only a boy, his heart was soft toward God."

        heading: "Seeking God’s Guidance",
        text: "When Josiah was 16 years old, the Bible says he began to seek the God of his ancestor David. Even though he had grown up surrounded by idolatry, Josiah longed to know the true God. He prayed, learned, and desired to do what was right. Then, at the age of 20, Josiah began to take strong action. He started to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from all forms of idol worship."

    {
        heading: "Cleansing the Land",
        text: "He went throughout the land, destroying high places, idols, Asherah poles, and carved and cast images. He even went into the former territories of Israel, tearing down altars that had been built to false gods. He crushed the idols into powder and scattered the dust over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. He also burned the bones of false priests on their altars, fulfilling the prophecy that the man of God had spoken during Jeroboam’s time, hundreds of years earlier. By doing this, Josiah showed that true worship of God cannot mix with idol worship. He completely cleansed the land and brought the people back to the fear of the Lord."

        heading: "Repairing the Temple",
        text: "In the eighteenth year of his reign (when he was about 26), Josiah decided to repair the Temple of the Lord, which had been neglected and damaged for many years. He sent his secretary Shaphan, the high priest Hilkiah, and other officials to oversee the work. They collected offerings from the people and gave them to the workers to restore the Temple faithfully."
    },
    {
        heading: "Discovery of the Book of the Law",
        text: "During the restoration, something extraordinary happened. Hilkiah the high priest found a scroll, which was identified as the Book of the Law of the Lord — the very words of God given through Moses, likely the book of Deuteronomy. For many years, it had been lost and forgotten! Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who read it, and then Shaphan took it to King Josiah."

    {
        heading: "Josiah’s Response to God’s Word",
        text: "When Shaphan read the words of the book aloud to the king, Josiah was deeply moved. As he listened to God’s commandments, curses, and warnings against disobedience, he realized how far Judah had strayed from God’s law. The Bible says Josiah tore his robes in grief and humility. He said, “Great is the Lord’s anger that burns against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words of this book or acted in accordance with all that is written concerning us.”"
    },
    {
        heading: "Consulting the Prophetess Huldah",
        text: "Immediately, Josiah sent Hilkiah and other officials to inquire of the Lord about what should be done. They went to a prophetess named Huldah, who lived in Jerusalem. She gave them a message from God: “This is what the Lord says: I am going to bring disaster on this place and its people, because they have forsaken Me and burned incense to other gods. But tell the king of Judah who sent you to inquire of the Lord — because your heart was responsive and you humbled yourself before Me when you heard My words, I have heard you. You will not see all the disaster that I will bring on this place; you will be gathered to your ancestors in peace.” This meant that although judgment would come to Judah for its sins, God showed mercy to Josiah because of his humility and repentance."

    {
        heading: "Reading the Law to the People",
        text: "After hearing this, Josiah gathered all the elders and people of Judah and read the Book of the Law aloud to them in the Temple. Everyone — men, women, and children — stood to listen. Then Josiah made a covenant before the Lord, promising to follow Him and keep His commandments with all his heart and soul. All the people pledged themselves to do the same."
    },
    {
        heading: "Nationwide Reformation",
        text: "Then Josiah began a nationwide reformation like no other. He ordered the removal of idols and altars from every part of Judah and even from the lands that once belonged to Israel. He destroyed the altar at Bethel, which Jeroboam had built long ago to lead Israel into sin. He burned the bones of false priests on that altar, exactly as had been foretold by the prophet from Judah during Jeroboam’s time. Josiah also removed the idolatrous priests that previous kings had appointed, tore down shrines dedicated to the sun, moon, and stars, and destroyed places where people had sacrificed their children to Molech. He even broke down the high places built by Solomon for foreign gods outside Jerusalem, which had stood for centuries. No idol or altar was left standing anywhere in the land."

    {
        heading: "Celebrating the Passover",
        text: "After cleansing the nation from idolatry, Josiah commanded all the people to celebrate the Passover — something that had not been done properly since the days of the prophet Samuel. The Passover in Josiah’s time was one of the most glorious in Israel’s history. The priests and Levites were organized carefully. The Ark of the Covenant was placed back in its rightful place. The Passover lambs were sacrificed, and the people celebrated with great joy and reverence. The Bible says, “Never since the days of the judges had there been such a Passover.” Josiah’s leadership brought back true worship, obedience, and unity among the people."

    {
        heading: "Josiah’s Character",
        text: "The Bible summarizes Josiah’s character with these powerful words: “Neither before nor after Josiah was there a king like him who turned to the Lord as he did — with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, in accordance with all the Law of Moses.”"
    },
    {
        heading: "Peace and Later Years",
        text: "However, even though Josiah was faithful, God’s judgment on Judah could not be fully turned away, because of the long years of sin under Manasseh and other kings. Yet during Josiah’s lifetime, there was peace, and the people lived under the blessing of his righteous rule."

    {
        heading: "Death at Megiddo",
        text: "In the later years of his reign, King Neco of Egypt marched north to fight against Assyria, and Josiah decided to confront him at Megiddo. King Neco sent messengers, saying that he had no quarrel with Judah and that God had told him to hurry. But Josiah refused to listen. He disguised himself and went into battle. During the battle, archers shot Josiah, and he was mortally wounded. His servants took him back to Jerusalem, where he died. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned deeply for Josiah. The prophet Jeremiah wrote laments for him, and the people remembered him with great sorrow. His death was a national tragedy, for Josiah had been the last godly king before Judah’s final downfall. His son Jehoahaz became king after him, but he did not follow in his father’s righteous ways."

    {
        heading: "Josiah’s Legacy",
        text: "King Josiah’s life teaches us that one person’s faithfulness can change an entire nation. Even though he was young, Josiah chose to seek God and obey His Word completely. He loved the Scriptures, humbled himself when corrected, and acted courageously to destroy evil and restore true worship. Josiah’s story shows that revival begins in the heart — when we read God’s Word, repent, and commit ourselves to obey it. His example reminds us that it’s never too late to turn back to God, and that obedience brings blessing, even in the midst of a corrupt generation."
