        text: "King Zechariah was the son of Jeroboam II and the last king from the dynasty of Jehu. His story is found mainly in 2 Kings 15:8–12. Though his reign was short, it marked the end of a royal line that had ruled the northern kingdom of Israel for about a century."

        heading: "Zechariah Becomes King",
        text: "Zechariah became king of Israel in Samaria during the thirty-eighth year of Uzziah, the king of Judah. His father, Jeroboam II, had been one of Israel’s most successful kings—he had brought peace, wealth, and expansion to the kingdom. When Zechariah took the throne, people might have hoped for that same prosperity to continue. But things were not the same anymore. Though the nation looked strong on the outside, it was weak inside. There was corruption, idolatry, and moral decay everywhere."

    {
        heading: "Zechariah’s Sinful Reign",
        text: "Zechariah did not follow God faithfully. The Bible says he did evil in the sight of the Lord, just as his ancestors had done. He continued to lead Israel in the sins of Jeroboam, the first king of the northern kingdom—the sin of worshiping the golden calves in Bethel and Dan. These idols were meant to represent God but were false and against His commandments. Because of these sins, the nation’s heart remained far from God, even though they still thought they were religious."

    {
        heading: "A Short Reign and Sudden Death",
        text: "His reign lasted only six months—a very short and unstable period. During this time, political unrest was growing. The people were not satisfied with their leaders, and there were many plots and power struggles among the military and the nobles."

        heading: "Shallum’s Conspiracy",
        text: "One of the men in his army, named Shallum son of Jabesh, conspired against him. Shallum gathered support, attacked Zechariah publicly before the people, and killed him. After killing Zechariah, Shallum took the throne and declared himself king. This sudden and violent act showed how unstable and divided the northern kingdom had become."

    {
        heading: "Fulfillment of God’s Prophecy",
        text: "Zechariah’s death fulfilled a prophecy that God had given long before to Jehu, Zechariah’s great-great-grandfather. When Jehu was anointed king, God told him that his descendants would rule over Israel up to the fourth generation (2 Kings 10:30). And that’s exactly what happened—Jehu, Jehoahaz, Joash, Jeroboam II, and Zechariah were the four generations. With Zechariah’s death, Jehu’s dynasty came to an end, just as the Lord had said."

    {
        heading: "Meaning of Zechariah’s Story",
        text: "Zechariah’s story is short but carries deep meaning. It shows how God’s promises always come true—both the promises of blessings and of judgment. It also reveals how the northern kingdom of Israel had drifted far from God. Even though they had seen His patience and mercy through many kings, they refused to turn back to Him. The result was chaos, violence, and instability."
    },
    {
        heading: "After Zechariah’s Death",
        text: "After Zechariah’s death, the kingdom of Israel entered a time of great disorder. Kings came and went rapidly, many through murder and rebellion. It was a clear sign that the nation was nearing its final downfall, which would come some years later when the Assyrians invaded and destroyed Israel."
    },
    {
        heading: "End of Jehu’s Dynasty",
        text: "So, King Zechariah’s reign, though only six months, stands as a turning point in Israel’s history. It marks the end of a long family line, the fulfillment of God’s word, and the beginning of Israel’s last, tragic chapter."
