God can change people and events. One example is Joseph. His brothers had intended to hurt him. But Joseph believed that God had a purpose for him. God intended him to save lives in Egypt (Genesis 50:20).\n\nPeople often think that they have found new things. People may invent something that is new. But they use what God has created.

The Teacher refers to ‘God’s house’ in Ecclesiastes 5:1-7. People put plants that are called vines in *vineyards. And these plants produce small fruit that are called grapes. Then people squeeze the grapes to get juice. Then they make wine from the juice.\n\nVerse 5 Gardens belonged to important people. A person needed a lot of land where he could plant so many trees and plants.\n\nVerse 6 There was a pool in Jerusalem called the ‘king’s pool’ (Nehemiah 2:14). Another writer thought that Solomon had made it.\n\nVerse 7 The Teacher owned many slaves. This showed to everyone that he was wealthy. Every day Solomon needed enormous numbers of animals to provide the meals for his people. He had to feed all the people who lived in his palace (1 Kings 4:22-23).\n\nVerse 8 King Solomon had great quantities of gold (1 Kings chapter 10). And silver was ‘as common as stone’ (1 Kings 10:27). Apart from his personal wealth, he also received gifts. And money came to him from taxes in foreign countries where he ruled.\n\nSingers provided music to please his guests at splendid meals.\n\nMany women belonged to him. They lived with him in addition to his real wives. Apart from his many wives, King Solomon had 300 other women who lived in his home (1 Kings 11:3).\n\nVerse 9 The Teacher says that he was the most powerful person in Jerusalem. He was the most powerful person who had ever lived there. But he reminds his readers that he always continued to think wisely. He wanted to test and to discover why people live in this world. Everything that he did was for that reason.\n\nVerses 10-11 The Teacher had done his experiment in a way that tested everything. He had wanted to enjoy everything. And he was happy with his work. He was interested in his work as he continued his plans. But then he thought about what he had achieved. He thought about all his hard work. Then he realised the truth. He had done it all to please himself. This disappointed him. There is no permanent benefit if you search merely for your own happiness. It is impossible to discover the purpose of our lives.

Some activities create things and other activities destroy things.\n\n1) There is a right time for a farmer to plant his seed. There is a right time for him to harvest his crop. The words ‘to plant’ and ‘to pull up’ may also refer to God’s actions. He had ‘planted’ *Israel in their country like a farmer plants his seed. But *Israel’s people did not obey God, so God had to punish them. He allowed their enemies to destroy their nation. The enemies were stealing the ‘crop’.\n\n2) ‘To kill’ may mean ‘to suffer’ (or ‘to have difficulties’) as well. *Israel’s people had difficulties because they had not obeyed God. Only God could ‘cure’ the nation. He would rescue the nation if the people began to obey him. God said this in Deuteronomy 32:39: ‘I cause death and I make people alive.’\n\n3) ‘To pull down’ and ‘to build up’ describe people’s actions. They could be either bad actions or good actions. To gossip about someone can ‘pull down’ (ruin) that person’s character. There is never a right time to speak cruel words about people. Words that encourage will ‘build up’ a person. Those words help him to become a more confident person. God told Jeremiah ‘to tear down’. God told him also ‘to build up’. Jeremiah must remove wrong beliefs and actions. He must warn nations that God would be their judge. He also gave a message that spoke about hope (Jeremiah 1:10). The *Jews were living in a distant country called Babylon. But Jeremiah caused them to hope. At the right time, God would take them back to their own country. He would ‘build them up and he would not tear them down’ (Jeremiah 24:6)."

Men need to clear the stones away before they can plant a crop (Isaiah 5:2). Then people can gather those stones to build a wall round the field (Matthew 21:33).\n\n2) People sometimes scattered stones on a field because they wanted to ruin an enemy’s crops (2 Kings 3:19, 25). ‘To gather’ perhaps means ‘to show friendship’. Perhaps friends would help someone to clear the stones from his ground.\n\n3) ‘To scatter stones’ may mean ‘to destroy’. Then ‘to gather stones’ would mean ‘to build again’.\n\n4) It might be a special way in *Hebrew to talk about sex. It may refer to two people when they have sex. So, there is a time to have sex. And there is a time not to have sex (1 Corinthians 7:1-7).\n\nThere is a suitable time to hug someone. That shows friendship or love. But there is a time when you should not hug them.

We should be silent when we are listening. We should not share secret information with other people (Proverbs 20:19). But there is also a right time to speak. It might be the right time to correct someone. Perhaps they did not understand what someone had said. Perhaps other people had not understood them.

Their graves will be in the earth and their bodies will become dust again. So the bodies of people have no advantage over the bodies of animals. The *spirit of an animal just refers to their breath, which is just physical. But the Teacher thinks about whether any part of a human being goes up to heaven. Nobody can be sure about what happens to people after their death. Therefore, the Teacher thought in the end that it is best for a person to enjoy their life here on the earth. But Christians can be sure about a future that is in heaven. The *New Testament shows this (John 10:25; 11:25; 3 times the Teacher has given the advice that people should enjoy their lives. (See also Ecclesiastes 2:24; 3:12). ‘Work’ may include all the activities that people can enjoy.

And people thought that a long life was good. Old people thought that God was *blessing them especially. But it was very bad to die without a proper grave. This showed that the dead person had no value. Jeremiah spoke about the wicked king who was called Jehoiakim. Nobody will be sad about his death. And his body will have no grave (Jeremiah 22:18-19).\n\nSomeone might have many children and he might live for a long time. But if he is not happy, then it is a sad situation. So it would be better for him if he had died before his birth. Sometimes, sadly, a child is born dead. Such a child never knows what happens here on the earth. Our lives are a gift from God. God wants us to think about him while we are alive. And God wants us to think about other people. Nobody knows what a dead baby’s character might have become. But this child does not have to live with difficulties and troubles. So the dead baby’s rest is more peaceful than the rich man’s rest. The rich man might live twice as long as Methuselah.

These women want to see men do wrong things. This kind of woman will prevent people who want to escape from her. It was as if she tied up people with chains. This kind of woman may be someone who is attracting men to herself. She may want to have sex with them. But perhaps this ‘woman’ is a way to describe foolish ideas. These ideas cause people to do wrong things. The Book of Proverbs, in chapters 5 and 7, talks about foolish men. They agree when a woman suggests wrong things to them. Instead, we must be wise. We must not allow false ideas to attract us. If we respect God, then we will avoid the wrong thoughts. We know that these thoughts are like a trap. And bad women will try to persuade foolish men. In the *New Testament, the Christians who lived in the town called Colossae were in danger. That was because they were willing to believe false ideas. They needed to trust Christ only. Paul warned them not to become prisoners of those foolish ideas (Colossians 2:8)."

He should choose what is the wisest way to live. ‘What you see’ means this: He should notice what is the best way to live. He must remember that God will be his judge. Also, God is the judge, even while people are living. God allows them to suffer the results of their wrong actions. But this verse probably refers to the final day of judgement. The *Hebrew words say that ‘God will bring you into the judgement.’ A person should not forget to act in the right way. We know that God is powerful. And his judgement will be completely fair."

God created him. So God has the right to demand things. And he demands that young people should obey him all their lives. This poem gives many examples that show old age. When we are old, many things may be more difficult. We may have more problems as we become old. We may not remember God because of those problems. Then we will be sorry that we cannot enjoy ourselves. These words can mean also that there is no more time for pleasure."

And you will be unable to guard your house. You will be like a mill without stones, because your teeth will fall out. And then you will not be able to eat properly. Your eyes will be like dirty windows, so that you will not be able to see clearly. You will not be strong enough to open the doors into the street. And it will be difficult for you to hear anything. You will not hear the stones that are making corn into flour. The birds’ song early in the morning will disturb you. Then you will get up too early. But it will be hard to hear music. You will be afraid to climb up to a high place. And you will expect to meet dangerous things in the street. Your hair will turn white like the flowers that are on the *almond tree. And you will drag yourself along like an old *grasshopper. You will not have desires because you are too old.\n\nAdditional explanations:\n   -- Young people can protect a house from danger. Psalm 147:10 speaks about men’s legs as a sign of strength. Young people have strong legs and strong arms. But as a person becomes old, their arms and legs become weak.\n   -- A mill needs special big stones to make flour from corn. The Teacher thinks that people’s teeth are like those stones. Old people’s teeth often fall out. So they will find it difficult to eat.\n   -- Also, when people become old, their eyes cannot see as clearly.\n   -- Old people cannot open doors easily. So they cannot go very far. And old people may become deaf. Then they cannot hear ordinary sounds from outside their house or room.\n   -- When birds begin to sing early in the morning, old people cannot sleep. So they get up early. But they cannot appreciate music. One example is old Barzillai. He refused King David’s invitation to go to Jerusalem. He said that he could not hear men and women. He could not hear them sing (2 Samuel 19:33-35).\n   -- It is an effort for old people to climb hills or steps to high places. Their legs are stiff. They are afraid that they will fall. They are afraid that people might push against them.\n   -- The grasshopper is an insect that jumps. It is usually very active. But it may be cold or injured. Then it drags itself along. Another translation is ‘the *grasshopper insect becomes a heavy load’. This would mean that old people cannot carry even light things. An old person loses interest in many things. They may think that even their great desires have become unimportant.\n   -- All people die. They go to a permanent place. And the people who weep for them may be family, friends, or professional mourners. ‘They walk along the streets’ may mean that these people are looking for a job, waiting to do their work at a funeral."

            text: "These words make us think about the end of things. They refer to death. Silver and gold are precious metals. So our lives are precious. A basin or anything may hang from a silver chain. But it will suffer great damage if the chain breaks suddenly. Someone may make a jar out of wet material from the ground. They use heat to make it hard. But this kind of jar can break into many pieces. If the jar hits against something, it may break. If someone drops it, it will break. A person’s life is also weak and ends quickly. People pull up water in a bucket from a well. A wheel with a thick string helps them. But if the wheel breaks, the bucket may fall into the well. Then nobody can get water. The water here refers to life. So this idea describes the end of life.\n\n‘Dust’ and ‘ground’ emphasise people’s physical origin (Genesis 2:7). Also, ‘God remembers that we are only dust’ (Psalm 103:14). The person’s *spirit or breath will return to God who gave it. (‘*Spirit’ and ‘breath’ are the same word in Hebrew.) When their *spirit leaves people, their body begins to return to dust. The Teacher compares these two things: ‘Return like dust to the ground’ and ‘return to God’. He means that the person will continue to exist."

            text: "These final remarks are in two parts:\n\n1) Verses 9-11 praise the Teacher’s work.\n- The Teacher was like Moses (Deuteronomy 6:1) and like Ezra (Ezra 7:10), and like other great leaders. They all wanted to teach God’s laws to people. Before the Teacher wrote his message, he studied. He made every effort to understand other people’s wise words. And he chose the best way to explain his ideas. He wanted people to read them. People should read his ideas with pleasure. They should think that the ideas were attractive. What he wrote was honest and true.\n- Farmers used sharp sticks to make their animals move. And then the animals went in the right direction. In the same way, the Teacher’s words should encourage people to act. He wants them to act in the right way. He collected these wise words so that they would remain in people’s minds. He wanted people to remember the words for a long time. The words should be like nails that remain firm in wood. The person who looks after sheep is called the ‘shepherd’. The Teacher is probably referring to God. King David wrote about God who was his Shepherd (Psalm 23:1) and called God the ‘Shepherd of the *Israelites’ (Psalm 80:1). So the Teacher’s words have authority because God gave them to him. And the Teacher made every effort to write them in the best way.\n\n2) Verses 12-14 are the final message from the Teacher.\n- The Teacher warns his son about words in books that were not helpful. People who read books need to be cautious. They must be careful about what they read.\n- The Teacher warns people not to study too much. Excessive study is not helpful if it makes the body weak.\n- The Teacher concludes his message by reminding readers to fear God. People should realise that God is great and hates *sin. Then they will be wise and want to obey God. ‘People who are afraid to make God angry are starting to be wise’ (Psalm 111:10). Everyone should obey God. The Teacher warns that God is the judge of everyone. God knows secret thoughts and everything that we do (Psalm 90:8). In the New Testament, Paul says God knows the reasons for everyone’s actions (1 Corinthians 4:5). Jesus said even the smallest detail matters to God (Luke 12:6-7). Many questions about our lives seem unanswered. But God is in control. He wants us to trust Him, enjoy life, and remember that God is our judge."
