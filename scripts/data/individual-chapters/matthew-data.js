            text: "The <b>Gospel</b> of Matthew is an account of Jesus’ life. It records what Jesus taught. And it records what Jesus did.\n\nMatthew began his <b>Gospel</b> with a list of the <b>ancestors</b> of Jesus. The record is from Abraham to Joseph, the husband of Mary. Joseph was not the father of Jesus. But in <b>Jewish</b> law, Jesus belonged to Joseph’s family. Luke records the history from Jesus back to Adam. It might be that Luke recorded the <b>ancestors</b> of Mary’s family. But we are not sure about this. Both Joseph and Mary were <b>descendants</b> of King David and of Abraham.\n\nJesus was called ‘the son of David’. This meant that he was a direct male <b>descendant</b> of King David. The <b>Jews</b> understood that ‘the son of David’ referred to the <b>Christ</b> (Matthew 22:41-46). In Jesus’ day, many <b>Jews</b> expected the <b>Christ</b> to come. And several times Jesus was called ‘son of David’ (Matthew 9:27, 12:23, 15:22, 20:30, 21:9, 21:15). We sometimes refer to the <b>Christ</b> as ‘King David’s greater son’. In other words, Jesus is a <b>descendant</b> of David, but he is more important than David. Jesus is both the <b>Christ</b> and the king. He is the king of the <b>Jews</b>.\n\nJesus was also called ‘the son of Abraham’. This meant that he was a direct male <b>descendant</b> of Abraham. Abraham was the <b>ancestor</b> of the <b>Jews</b>. To them he was their ‘father’. And they were proud to be his <b>descendants</b>. The word ‘father’ did not always mean the immediate parent. It often meant an earlier <b>ancestor</b>. It would be by a <b>descendant</b> of Abraham that God would <b>bless</b> all nations (Genesis 22:18). God did this by means of what Jesus achieved by his death. The death of Jesus was for all people. He told his <b>disciples</b> to <b>preach</b> the good news about him to all nations (Matthew 28:18-20). So by means of Jesus, the <b>Christ</b>, God <b>blesses</b> people from every nation.\n\nThe <b>Jews</b> considered their family history to be very important. From early times, there were public records. Matthew arranges the history in three groups.\n\n- The first group is from Abraham to David (Matthew 1:2-6).\n- The second group is from Solomon to the <b>exile</b> in Babylon (Matthew 1:7-11).\n- Then the final group is from Jechoniah to the birth of Jesus (Matthew 1:12-16).\n\nMatthew makes this to be three sets of 14 names in each (Matthew 1:17). It is not clear why Matthew did this. But in order to achieve it, Matthew has left out some names. In the second group after Jotham, Matthew has left out Ahaziah, Joash and Amaziah (1 Chronicles 3:11-12). The third group is for a period of about 500 years. Matthew records only 13 names for this period."

            text: "Tamar is the first of 5 women that Matthew includes in the list. It was not usual to include women in the family lists. Also, she was not married to Judah when they had Perez and Zerah. She had been the wife of Judah’s son Er, but he died. The law at that time was that the next son should marry the widow. Onan would not have children for his brother Er, and Onan died. Judah would not allow Tamar to marry his other sons. The story of how she had sons by Judah is in Genesis chapter 38. Matthew mentions both Perez and Zerah. This may be because they were born at the same time.\n\nThe second woman in the list is Rahab. She was a foreigner. But she had helped the <b>Israelite</b> men who had come to Jericho. So, the <b>Israelites</b> saved her when they destroyed Jericho (Joshua chapter 6). Later she became the mother of Boaz.\n\nThe next woman in the list is Ruth. She was a foreigner from the country called Moab. Ruth married Boaz (Ruth 4:10-12).\n\nWhen Matthew came to David, he called him King David. Matthew made it clear that Jesus was from the royal family. It was right that Jesus was called the king of the <b>Jews</b>.\n\nAminadab was in the desert with Moses (Numbers 1:7). That was about 400 years after the <b>Israelites</b> went to Egypt. In this list, there are just 4 names for that period. They are Perez, Hezron, Aram and Aminadab. So, Matthew must have left out several names here. In the same way, he may have left out some names between Aminadab and David."

            text: "David became the father of Solomon. Solomon’s mother, Bathsheba, had been Uriah’s wife. David had arranged the death of Uriah because of his affair with Bathsheba (2 Samuel 11:14-26). So, Bathsheba is the 4th woman in the list but Matthew does not record her name.\n\nFrom the family of King David, his <b>descendants</b> ruled as kings until the <b>exile</b> in Babylon. From then on, <b>Israel</b> had no kings."

            text: "In this last section, there are 13 men’s names instead of 14. Had Matthew included Jehoiakim there would have been 14. Jehoiakim was the father of Jeconiah (1 Chronicles 3:16). But perhaps Matthew counted Jesus as the 14th name.\n\nWe have no other record of the 9 names from Abiud to Jacob. Probably they were in public or family records that Matthew copied.\n\nThe list ends with Joseph. He was Mary’s husband. She is the 5th woman in this list. Joseph was not the natural father of Jesus but he was the legal father. All the other men in the list had natural fathers. But Jesus had no human father. Jesus was the <b>Son of God</b>."

            text: "The number 14 was important to Matthew and perhaps to his first readers. But we do not know why it was important. However, 14 is of course double the number 7. The Bible sometimes seems to use the number 7 to express the idea that something was complete or perfect (for example, Genesis 2:2-3; Revelation 1:4; Revelation 1:20)."
