        heading: "King Jotham – The Faithful King Who Walked Steadily with God",
        text: "King Jotham was one of the kings of Judah who followed in the good ways of his father and walked faithfully before God. His story is found mainly in **2 Kings 15:32–38** and **2 Chronicles 27**. He was the **son of King Uzziah (also called Azariah)** and became king after his father was struck with leprosy. Jotham’s reign stands out because, in a time when many kings turned away from God, he remained faithful, obedient, and wise."

        heading: "Jotham’s Early Life and Background",
        text: "Jotham became king at the age of **25**, and he ruled in **Jerusalem for 16 years**. His mother was **Jerushah**, the daughter of Zadok — a name that connects to a priestly family, which means Jotham grew up with both royal and spiritual guidance. From the start, he showed himself to be a man of good character and responsibility."

    {
        heading: "Lessons from His Father Uzziah",
        text: "Jotham’s father, Uzziah, had been a great king who built up Judah’s army and made the nation strong, but toward the end of his life, pride caused him to sin against God. Uzziah entered the temple to burn incense — something only priests were allowed to do — and as punishment, God struck him with leprosy. Because of this, Uzziah had to live in isolation, and his son Jotham began to govern the kingdom as a **co-regent** (sharing power) before officially becoming king after his father’s death."
    },
    {
        heading: "Jotham’s Faith and Obedience",
        text: "From those early years, Jotham learned many lessons about leadership, humility, and obedience to God. He saw firsthand what pride and disobedience could do, and he decided to live differently. The Bible says, *“He did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, just as his father Uzziah had done — but he did not enter the temple of the Lord.”* That means he respected the boundaries God had set and did not make the same mistake his father had made."

    {
        heading: "Jotham’s Building Projects and Achievements",
        text: "Under Jotham’s rule, Judah experienced stability and progress. He continued his father’s work of strengthening the kingdom, both militarily and economically. Jotham built extensively — he constructed the **Upper Gate of the temple of the Lord**, which may have served as an important entrance for worshippers or royal processions. He also built **walls around the hill of Ophel**, a fortified area near the temple in Jerusalem, and built **cities, towers, and fortresses** in the hill country of Judah and in the forests."
    },
    {
        heading: "A Strong and Wise Leader",
        text: "These building projects showed that Jotham was not lazy or careless. He worked to protect his people, to strengthen Jerusalem, and to expand Judah’s influence. His rule brought security and peace to the nation because of his wise and godly leadership."
    },
    {
        heading: "Jotham’s Spiritual Strength",
        text: "But Jotham was not only a builder of walls and towers — he was also a builder of character. The Bible says in **2 Chronicles 27:6**, *“Jotham grew powerful because he walked steadfastly before the Lord his God.”* This is one of the most beautiful verses about him. It shows that his success was not because of military strength or wealth but because he faithfully followed God. His life was steady and consistent. He didn’t make grand mistakes or dramatic rebellions like some other kings. Instead, he quietly did what was right day after day, and God blessed him for it."

    {
        heading: "The People’s Corruption",
        text: "However, not everyone in Judah followed his good example. The Bible says, *“The people still continued their corrupt practices.”* Even though Jotham led with integrity, many of his subjects were stubborn and sinful. They kept worshiping idols and living in disobedience. This shows that even a righteous leader cannot always change the hearts of the people. Still, Jotham did not let their behavior turn him away from God. He stayed faithful, proving that a person can live righteously even when surrounded by sin."

    {
        heading: "Victory Over the Ammonites",
        text: "During his reign, Jotham also faced some political challenges. The **king of Ammon**, who had been under Judah’s control, rebelled against him. But Jotham defeated the Ammonites in battle and made them pay a heavy tribute. Each year, they brought him **100 talents of silver, 10,000 measures of wheat, and 10,000 measures of barley**. This victory showed his strength and wisdom as a leader and helped strengthen Judah’s economy."
    },
    {
        heading: "Jotham’s Quiet Strength",
        text: "Even though he faced enemies, God gave Jotham victory because he trusted in Him. Unlike many other kings, Jotham did not turn to foreign powers for help, nor did he rely on idols. He relied on the Lord alone. His reign was marked by quiet strength, steady faith, and wise leadership."
    },
    {
        heading: "The Failure of His Successor",
        text: "Sadly, his good example was not continued by his son. After Jotham’s death, his son **Ahaz** became king, and Ahaz turned away from God completely. Ahaz undid much of the good his father had done by bringing idolatry and pagan worship into Judah. This shows that even though Jotham was righteous, every person still must choose for themselves whether they will follow God or not."
    },
    {
        heading: "Jotham’s Death and Honor",
        text: "When Jotham died, he was buried in the **City of David**, the traditional burial place for kings. The people honored him for his faithfulness and leadership."
    },
    {
        heading: "A Quiet but Faithful Example",
        text: "King Jotham’s story might seem quieter compared to others — he didn’t have dramatic wars, miracles, or scandals — but his life shines as an example of **steady faithfulness**. He wasn’t proud like his father or wicked like his son. He lived with humility, strength, and obedience."
    },
    {
        heading: "The Lesson from Jotham’s Life",
        text: "His life teaches us that faithfulness to God doesn’t always mean doing big or famous things. Sometimes, it means doing the right thing quietly and consistently, even when others don’t follow. Jotham didn’t seek power or fame; he simply sought to please God. And because of that, he was strong and successful."
    },
    {
        heading: "The Legacy of Jotham",
        text: "So, King Jotham’s story is the story of a man who **walked steadily with God**, who ruled wisely, built faithfully, and left behind a legacy of righteousness. In a time when many kings fell into pride and sin, Jotham stood firm — showing that true greatness comes from walking faithfully with the Lord day by day."
