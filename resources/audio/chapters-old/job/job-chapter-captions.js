            text: "There was once a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was known as a very good and upright man. He always respected God and stayed away from doing evil. Job was a man who wanted to please God in everything. He tried hard to live a clean and honest life."
        },
        {
            text: "Job had a large family and was also very rich. He had seven sons and three daughters, and he owned a huge number of animals — seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred pairs of oxen, and five hundred donkeys. He also had many servants who worked for him. He was one of the richest and most respected men in all the East. Everyone knew him for his goodness and his success."
        },
        {
            text: "Job’s children loved to celebrate together. On their birthdays, each son used to hold a feast in his house and invite all his brothers and sisters to come and eat and drink with him. These were happy family gatherings. After the days of feasting were over, Job would always call his children and offer sacrifices to God on their behalf. He thought, “Maybe my sons or daughters have sinned during the feast. Maybe they have said something wrong in their hearts against God.” So Job wanted to make sure they were forgiven. He did this regularly, showing how deeply he cared for his family’s spiritual life."

        {
            text: "Then the story shifts to what happens in heaven. One day, the angels (also called the “sons of God”) came before the Lord, and Satan also came among them. The Lord asked Satan where he had come from. Satan replied that he had been roaming around the earth, going here and there. Then the Lord said, “Have you noticed my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him — he is a man who fears God and stays away from evil.”"
        },
        {
            text: "Satan answered, “Of course Job fears You. But is it for nothing? You have blessed him in every way! You have protected him, his family, and all his possessions. Everything he does is successful. You have made him rich. But if You stretch out Your hand and take away what he has, surely he will curse You to Your face.”"
        },
        {
            text: "Then the Lord said to Satan, “Very well. Everything that Job has is in your power. But you must not harm Job himself.” So Satan left the Lord’s presence, ready to test Job."

        {
            text: "After some time, disaster suddenly began to strike Job. One day, while Job’s children were feasting and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, a servant came running to Job with terrible news. He said, “The oxen were ploughing and the donkeys were grazing nearby, when the Sabeans attacked. They took away the animals and killed the servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"
        },
        {
            text: "Before that man could even finish speaking, another servant arrived and said, “Lightning from heaven fell and burned up the sheep and the servants, and I am the only one who escaped to tell you.”"

        {
            text: "Then a third servant came and said, “The Chaldeans formed three raiding parties. They attacked your camels and took them away, killing all the servants. I alone escaped to tell you.”"

        {
            text: "While he was still speaking, a fourth messenger rushed in with the worst news of all. He said, “Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother’s house, when suddenly a strong wind came from the desert. It struck the house, and it collapsed on them. All your children are dead. I alone escaped to tell you.”"
        },
        {
            text: "In one single day, Job lost almost everything — his wealth, his animals, his servants, and even his beloved children. The pain was beyond words. Job tore his robe and shaved his head, which were signs of deep sorrow in those days. Then he fell down to the ground — but not in anger. He fell down to worship God."
        },
        {
            text: "He said, “I came from my mother’s womb with nothing, and I will leave this world with nothing. The Lord gave me everything I had, and the Lord has taken it away. Blessed be the name of the Lord.”"
        },
        {

            text: "Then the Lord said again, “Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one on earth like him. He is a good and honest man. He fears God and avoids evil. Even after you made me allow you to harm everything he had, he still holds firmly to his faith. He has not turned against me.”"

            text: "Then Satan caused Job to become very sick. Painful boils and sores appeared all over his body—from the top of his head to the soles of his feet. The pain was terrible. Job sat among the ashes, trying to find some relief. He took a broken piece of pottery and used it to scrape his skin, trying to ease the itching and burning pain. It was a miserable and lonely scene—this once great man, now suffering in silence, sitting on the ground in ashes."

        {
            text: "Then Job’s wife came to him. She saw the suffering, the pain, and the loss that Job was going through. She said, “Are you still holding on to your faith in God? Curse God and die!” She thought death would be better than such a miserable life."
        },
        {
            text: "But Job answered her calmly and wisely. He said, “You are talking like a foolish woman. Should we accept only good things from God, and not trouble?” In other words, Job reminded her that if we thank God when things go well, we should also trust Him when things go wrong. God is still God in both times."

            text: "When they came near, they could hardly recognize him. His face and body were so disfigured with sores and pain that he didn’t even look like the same man. When they saw him, they were overcome with grief. They wept loudly, tore their clothes in sorrow, and sprinkled dust on their heads — these were ancient signs of mourning."
