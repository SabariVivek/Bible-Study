            text: "This chapter begins with a message from God that was given to the prophet Nahum. The message is about the city of Nineveh. It shows that God is angry with the people there because of their evil and cruelty. Nahum says that God is a jealous and powerful God who punishes those who do wrong. The Lord takes revenge on His enemies, but He is also patient and slow to anger. He is strong and just, and no one can escape from His power when He decides to bring judgment."

            text: "Nahum describes how mighty God is. When He comes, storms and whirlwinds appear. The clouds are like the dust under His feet. He can dry up the seas and rivers with a word. The mountains shake, the hills melt, and the earth trembles when He appears. No one can stand before His anger, for His fury is like fire that burns everything in its path."

            text: "But Nahum also says that God is good. He is a safe place for people who trust Him, and He protects those who come to Him for help. Even though He destroys His enemies, He cares for those who love Him."

        {
            text: "Then the message turns directly toward Nineveh. God says He will completely destroy those who plot evil against Him. Even if the enemies of Judah are strong and have many people, they will be cut down and disappear. God promises His people that their suffering will end. The heavy burden that Assyria placed on Judah will be taken away, and their chains will be broken."
