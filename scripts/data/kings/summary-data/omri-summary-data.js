        heading: "King Omri – The Builder of Samaria and the Father of a Wicked Dynasty",
        text: "King Omri was one of the most powerful kings of the northern kingdom of Israel, though not a righteous one. His story is told in 1 Kings 16:15–28. He was a strong military leader, a skilled organizer, and a builder who made Israel politically strong. But spiritually, he led the nation deeper into sin. His rule prepared the way for his son Ahab, one of the most wicked kings in Israel’s history."

        heading: "The Division After Zimri",
        text: "After the death of King Zimri, who had ruled only seven days, the kingdom of Israel fell into confusion and division. The people were divided into two groups. One group supported Omri, the commander of the army, while the other supported a man named Tibni son of Ginath. Both men wanted to be king, and there was a long struggle between them."

        heading: "Civil War and Omri’s Rise",
        text: "Omri was already well-known because he was the commander of the army under the previous kings. The soldiers respected him as a strong and capable leader. On the other hand, Tibni also had supporters among the people. The division caused civil war in Israel — one part of the nation followed Tibni, and another part followed Omri. This internal war lasted for several years, causing instability and suffering among the people. Finally, Tibni died — the Bible does not explain how — and Omri became the sole king of Israel. This marked the beginning of a new dynasty that would last for several generations."

        heading: "Omri Builds Samaria",
        text: "Omri reigned for 12 years in total. The first six years he ruled from Tirzah, which had been the capital city of Israel since the time of Baasha and Elah. But Omri wanted to build a new, stronger capital — one that would be easier to defend and more impressive to the surrounding nations. So, he bought a hill from a man named Shemer for two talents of silver. On that hill, Omri built a new city and named it Samaria, after the previous owner Shemer. This city, Samaria, became the permanent capital of the northern kingdom. It was built on a hill with strong fortifications, making it difficult for enemies to attack. Omri’s decision to build Samaria was one of his greatest achievements politically and strategically. For many years after him, all the kings of Israel ruled from Samaria."

        heading: "Political Success but Spiritual Failure",
        text: "Omri made Israel politically powerful and stable. He strengthened alliances and may have built strong trade relations with other nations. He likely formed political ties with Phoenicia, which later became stronger during his son Ahab’s marriage to Jezebel, the daughter of the Phoenician king. This connection brought wealth and influence — but also terrible idolatry. The Bible, however, focuses not on Omri’s political success but on his spiritual failure. It says clearly that Omri “did evil in the eyes of the Lord, and did worse than all who were before him.” This means that, even though he was strong as a ruler, he was corrupt in his heart. He continued to follow the sinful ways of Jeroboam, the first king of Israel, who had made golden calves and led the people away from the true worship of God."

        heading: "Encouraging Idolatry",
        text: "Omri encouraged idol worship throughout the nation. He allowed and supported the worship of false gods, especially Baal and Asherah, which became more dominant during his son’s reign. Because of him, Israel continued to move far away from God. The people no longer obeyed God’s commandments or honored the temple in Jerusalem, as God had commanded through Moses. Though Omri’s reign brought military power and prosperity, it also deepened spiritual darkness. He built a great city, but he built it on a foundation of sin. His kingdom looked strong on the outside, but it was weak inside because it had turned away from God."

        heading: "Omri’s Lasting Influence",
        text: "Omri’s influence went far beyond his lifetime. The Bible says that later kings of Israel were compared to “the sins of Omri.” Even in the prophet Micah’s time, long after Omri was gone, God said, “You have kept the statutes of Omri and all the works of the house of Ahab.” This shows that Omri’s example of wickedness affected generations after him."

    {
        heading: "Death and Legacy",
        text: "After ruling for twelve years, Omri died and was buried in Samaria, the city he had built. His son Ahab became king after him. The Bible mentions very little about Omri’s death but quickly moves on to Ahab’s reign, showing that Omri’s most lasting legacy was his son — and unfortunately, Ahab continued and expanded his father’s evil ways. Omri’s dynasty became known as one of the most powerful but also one of the most sinful dynasties in Israel. He had succeeded in politics but failed in faith. His son Ahab married Jezebel, a Phoenician princess, and through that marriage, Baal worship spread all over Israel. What Omri had allowed, Ahab made official religion."

        heading: "Lesson from Omri’s Life",
        text: "So, King Omri’s story teaches us that earthly success cannot please God when it is built on sin. He built a city that became famous, but he also built a path of wickedness that led Israel toward destruction. His life reminds us that power, achievements, and strength mean nothing if the heart is not faithful to God. Omri might have been remembered by people as a great builder and leader, but in God’s eyes, he was a man who turned Israel further away from truth. His story warns us that in God’s sight, righteousness is greater than reputation, and obedience is worth more than strength or wealth."
