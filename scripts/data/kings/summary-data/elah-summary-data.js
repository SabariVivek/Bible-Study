        heading: "King Elah – The Short and Tragic Reign of Israel's King",
        text: "King Elah was the son of Baasha and became the king of the northern kingdom of Israel after his father's death. His story is recorded mainly in 1 Kings 16:6–14. Elah ruled Israel for only two years, and his reign is one of the shortest among all the kings. His time as king shows how quickly a kingdom can fall when the ruler lives in sin and disobedience to God."

        heading: "Elah's Background and Reign",
        text: "Elah came to the throne in the twenty-sixth year of Asa, king of Judah, and he ruled from the city of Tirzah, which was the capital of Israel at that time. His father, Baasha, had ruled for twenty-four years and was known for following the same wicked ways as Jeroboam, the first king of Israel. Baasha had led the people into idolatry and caused them to turn away from God. Even though God had given Baasha a chance to rule, he had not learned from the sins of Jeroboam, and his actions brought a curse on his family."

        heading: "Elah Continues His Father's Sins",
        text: "After Baasha's death, Elah became king. But instead of learning from his father's mistakes, Elah continued in the same sinful path. He followed the idol worship that had become common in Israel, and he did not seek the Lord. The Bible says that Elah \"did evil in the sight of the Lord,\" which means he did not try to please God or bring spiritual change to his people."

        heading: "Zimri's Conspiracy Against Elah",
        text: "During his reign, one of his military officers named Zimri, who was the commander of half of Elah's chariots, began to plot against him. Zimri saw that Elah was weak and careless, and he decided to take advantage of the situation to seize power for himself."

        heading: "Elah's Assassination",
        text: "One day, Elah was in Tirzah, drinking and getting drunk in the house of a man named Arza, who managed the palace. While Elah was drunk and unable to think clearly, Zimri came in and killed him, ending his short rule. This assassination happened suddenly, and there was no resistance or fight, because Elah's behavior had made him an easy target."

        heading: "Zimri Fulfills God's Judgment on Baasha's Family",
        text: "As soon as Zimri killed Elah, he declared himself king of Israel. Then, to fulfill the word of the Lord that had been spoken against Baasha's family through the prophet Jehu, Zimri killed every male in Baasha's family. He destroyed not only Elah but also all his relatives and close friends, so that no one from Baasha's line remained alive. This happened just as God had warned — because Baasha had sinned and led Israel into sin, God had decided to completely wipe out his family line, and it was fulfilled through Zimri's violent actions."

        heading: "Spiritual Meaning and Lesson from Elah's Reign",
        text: "Elah's death was not just a political event; it was also a spiritual judgment. His life and reign show how disobedience and sin can bring destruction, not only to a person but to an entire family. He did not learn from his father's mistakes, and because of that, he faced the same tragic end that God had warned about."

    {
        heading: "The Warning in Elah's Story",
        text: "In the end, Elah's story reminds us that being a king or a leader without following God leads only to downfall. His reign was marked by drunkenness, idolatry, and carelessness, and his death came suddenly, as a result of his own weakness and disobedience. His two-year rule ended with bloodshed and the complete destruction of his family."

        text: "Though Elah was a king, he never truly ruled — his heart was far from God, and his short, wasted life stands as a warning to all who choose to live in sin and ignore God's ways."
