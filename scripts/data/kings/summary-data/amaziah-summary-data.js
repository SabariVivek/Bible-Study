        heading: "King Amaziah – The King Who Started Well but Ended Proudly",
        text: "King Amaziah was the son of King Joash (Jehoash) and became the ninth king of Judah after his father was killed by his own servants. His story is found mainly in 2 Kings 14:1–20 and 2 Chronicles 25. Amaziah’s life is a story of a man who began well by obeying God but later allowed pride and idolatry to ruin him."

        heading: "Amaziah Becomes King",
        text: "Amaziah became king at the age of twenty-five, and he ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Jehoaddan, from Jerusalem. When Amaziah took the throne, his kingdom was still recovering from the troubles that had come during his father’s reign. His father, King Joash, had turned away from God in his later years and was murdered by his own officials. So when Amaziah began to rule, he wanted to bring order and justice back to the kingdom."

        heading: "Amaziah Shows Justice",
        text: "One of the first things Amaziah did as king was to punish the men who had killed his father. However, he did something very important — he obeyed the Law of Moses. The law said that children should not be killed for their fathers’ sins, nor should fathers be punished for their children’s sins. Each person was to die for his own sin. Amaziah followed this law and only punished the murderers themselves, showing that he respected God’s word and wanted to rule rightly."

        heading: "Strengthening the Army",
        text: "Amaziah strengthened his army. He gathered together 300,000 trained soldiers from Judah who could handle the spear and shield. He also decided to hire 100,000 fighting men from Israel (the northern kingdom) for a large amount of silver — one hundred talents. But a man of God came to him with a warning from the Lord. The prophet said, “O king, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for the Lord is not with Israel, nor with any of the people of Ephraim. If you go and take them, God will make you fall before the enemy, for God has power to help and to overthrow.”"

        heading: "Trusting God Over Wealth",
        text: "Amaziah was concerned about the money he had already spent to hire the soldiers. He asked, “But what about the hundred talents I have given to the Israelite army?” The man of God replied, “The Lord is able to give you much more than this.” This showed that Amaziah had to trust God’s power, not his money or numbers. Amaziah obeyed the prophet’s message, even though it meant losing his silver. He sent the hired soldiers back home."

        heading: "The Israelites’ Revenge",
        text: "However, those soldiers from Israel became very angry because they were dismissed without a fight. On their way home, they attacked several towns in Judah, from Samaria to Beth-horon, killing 3,000 people and taking much spoil. Even though Amaziah had obeyed God, he suffered some consequences because of their revenge."

        heading: "Victory Over Edom",
        text: "Then Amaziah led his own army to war against Edom (the people of Seir). With God’s help, he won a great victory. He killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt and captured the city of Sela, renaming it Joktheel. This victory could have made Amaziah more thankful to God — but instead, it led him toward pride and foolishness."

    {
        heading: "Amaziah’s Idolatry",
        text: "After defeating Edom, Amaziah brought back the idols of the Edomites — their gods made of stone — and set them up as his own gods. He began to bow down before them and offer sacrifices. This was a terrible sin, especially after God had just given him victory. The Lord became very angry and sent a prophet to rebuke Amaziah. The prophet said, “Why do you seek the gods of a people who could not even save them from your hand?” Amaziah interrupted the prophet angrily and said, “Have we made you an advisor to the king? Stop, or you will be struck down.” The prophet stopped but warned him, “I know that God has determined to destroy you, because you have done this and have not listened to His counsel.”"

    {
        heading: "The Battle with Israel",
        text: "Blinded by pride and arrogance, Amaziah then made another foolish decision. He challenged King Jehoash (Joash) of Israel to come and fight. The king of Israel sent back a wise and warning message through a parable: “A thistle in Lebanon sent to a cedar in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son as wife.’ But a wild beast passed by and trampled the thistle.” Jehoash explained that Amaziah was becoming proud because of his victory over Edom, but he should stay home instead of seeking unnecessary war."

    {
        heading: "Amaziah’s Defeat and Capture",
        text: "Amaziah ignored the warning. The two armies met in battle at Beth Shemesh, in Judah. Israel defeated Judah completely. Amaziah was captured, and King Jehoash of Israel came to Jerusalem, broke down part of the city wall — about 400 cubits (a large section) — and took away gold, silver, and treasures from the temple and the king’s palace. He also took hostages and returned to Samaria."

    {
        heading: "Amaziah’s Final Years and Death",
        text: "After this humiliating defeat, Amaziah lived for another fifteen years, but his popularity declined. The people of Judah began to turn against him, and a conspiracy was formed in Jerusalem to kill him. Amaziah fled to Lachish, a city in Judah, but the conspirators followed him there and killed him. His body was brought back on horses and buried in Jerusalem, with his ancestors in the city of David."

        heading: "Lessons from Amaziah’s Life",
        text: "Amaziah’s life is a lesson filled with both good and bad examples. In the beginning, he obeyed God’s law, showed justice, and trusted God’s word through the prophet. But later, pride and idolatry led him astray. He forgot that it was God who had given him victory, and instead of worshipping the true God, he turned to false idols. His downfall came because he stopped listening to God’s voice."

    {
        heading: "Spiritual Lesson",
        text: "King Amaziah’s story teaches us that starting well is not enough — we must continue to walk humbly with God until the end. When pride replaces obedience, even great victories can turn into great losses. Amaziah began his reign doing what was right in God’s eyes, but not with a perfect heart. And in the end, that imperfection — his pride and idolatry — led to his destruction."
