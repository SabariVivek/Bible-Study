        heading: "King Pekahiah – The King Who Continued in the Sins of Israel",
        text: "King Pekahiah was the son of King Menahem, and he became the seventeenth king of Israel after his father’s death. His story is found in 2 Kings 15:23–26. He ruled the northern kingdom of Israel from Samaria for two years. Though his reign was short, it showed how the nation of Israel continued to live in sin and rebellion against God even after many warnings and punishments."

        heading: "Pekahiah Becomes King After Menahem",
        text: "When King Menahem died, his son Pekahiah took over the throne. His father had ruled Israel with cruelty and had paid heavy tribute to the powerful Assyrian Empire to buy peace. So when Pekahiah became king, Israel was already under Assyria’s influence. The country was weak, spiritually and politically. People were still worshipping idols, and the kingdom was filled with corruption and division."

        heading: "Pekahiah’s Sinful Reign",
        text: "The Bible says that Pekahiah did evil in the sight of the Lord, and he did not turn away from the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin. This means that Pekahiah allowed the people to continue worshipping the golden calves that Jeroboam had set up in Bethel and Dan many years earlier. These idols had become a major reason for Israel’s downfall, but Pekahiah, like the kings before him, refused to destroy them or lead the people back to the true God."

        heading: "Unrest and Conspiracy in Israel",
        text: "During Pekahiah’s short reign, the land was full of unrest. Many people were unhappy with his leadership and the heavy control of Assyria over Israel. The army was divided, and there were men who secretly planned to overthrow him. Among them was Pekah son of Remaliah, one of Pekahiah’s trusted officers. Pekah was a powerful military commander and had strong support from some soldiers in the capital city of Samaria."

        heading: "The Assassination of King Pekahiah",
        text: "In time, Pekah plotted a conspiracy against King Pekahiah. He gathered support from fifty men of Gilead, a region east of the Jordan River, known for its strong warriors. When his plan was ready, Pekah and his men entered the royal palace in Samaria and killed King Pekahiah. Along with the king, they also killed two important men who were close to him — Argob and Arieh, his trusted officials. This event was sudden and violent, marking yet another act of bloodshed in Israel’s history."

    {
        heading: "Pekah Takes the Throne",
        text: "After Pekahiah’s death, Pekah son of Remaliah took the throne and became the next king of Israel. This assassination showed how unstable and chaotic the northern kingdom had become. In just a short time, Israel had seen one king after another killed by his own men. It was clear that the kingdom had lost God’s protection because it refused to turn away from idolatry and sin."

    {
        heading: "A Weak and Spiritually Empty Kingdom",
        text: "There are no records of Pekahiah fighting any wars or leading major campaigns. His short reign was mostly known for continuing his father’s policies, maintaining the same idol worship, and keeping the same alliance with Assyria that Menahem had made. But even with peace from foreign enemies, there was no peace within Israel itself. The people were spiritually empty, and the leaders were only interested in power, not righteousness."

    {
        heading: "The Path Toward Israel’s Fall",
        text: "Pekahiah’s death marked another step toward Israel’s final destruction. The northern kingdom would soon fall completely to the Assyrians, just a few years later, during the reign of King Hoshea. The sins that began with Jeroboam and continued through kings like Menahem and Pekahiah led the nation to its end."

    {
        heading: "A Reminder from King Pekahiah’s Life",
        text: "King Pekahiah’s story may seem short, but it is a powerful reminder that turning away from God always leads to instability and loss. Even though he inherited the throne and the chance to change his nation’s direction, Pekahiah chose to follow the same sinful path as his father and the kings before him. He had the opportunity to lead Israel back to God, but instead, he allowed idolatry to continue and trusted in political power rather than divine guidance."
    },
    {
        heading: "The Consequences of Sin and Rebellion",
        text: "In the end, Pekahiah’s life and reign were cut short by betrayal and murder — the same kind of violence that had brought his father to power. His story reflects how sin, when left uncorrected, always brings destruction — both to individuals and to nations."
