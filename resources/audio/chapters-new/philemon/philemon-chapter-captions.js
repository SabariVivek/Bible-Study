        {
            text: "This short letter was written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison. He wrote it to a Christian man named Philemon, who lived in Colossae and was known for his faith and love toward other believers. Paul also mentioned Apphia (probably Philemon’s wife), Archippus (a fellow worker), and the church that met in Philemon’s house. Paul begins the letter with a warm greeting, wishing them grace and peace from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."
        },
        {
            text: "Paul thanks God for Philemon whenever he prays. He says he has heard about Philemon’s strong faith in Jesus and his love for all God’s people. Paul tells him that he prays Philemon’s faith will continue to be active and bring understanding of all the good things they share in Christ. Paul says that Philemon’s love has brought great joy and encouragement to him because he has refreshed the hearts of other believers."
        },
        {
            text: "Then Paul comes to the main reason for writing the letter. He says that, even though he could order Philemon to do what is right, he prefers to appeal to him with love. Paul introduces a man named Onesimus, who had been Philemon’s slave but had run away. During Paul’s time in prison, Onesimus met Paul and became a believer in Christ. Paul calls him “my son Onesimus,” meaning a spiritual son because Paul led him to faith."
        },
        {
            text: "Paul says that Onesimus was once useless to Philemon, but now he has become useful both to Paul and to Philemon—his name “Onesimus” even means “useful.” Paul says he would have liked to keep Onesimus with him to help while he was in prison for preaching the gospel, but he decided to send him back to Philemon so that Philemon’s decision about him would be completely voluntary, not forced."
        },
        {
            text: "Paul gently suggests that maybe Onesimus’s running away happened for a reason—that now Philemon could have him back forever, not as a slave but as a beloved brother in Christ. Paul says, “If you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.” Then Paul adds, “If he has done anything wrong or owes you anything, charge it to me. I will repay it.” Paul even writes this with his own hand to show that he truly means it."
        },
        {
            text: "Paul reminds Philemon that he also owes him something—his very self, because Paul had helped lead him to faith. He expresses confidence that Philemon will do even more than Paul asks. Paul also says he hopes to visit soon, so he asks Philemon to prepare a guest room for him, trusting that God will answer their prayers for his release from prison."
        },
        {
            text: "At the end, Paul sends greetings from his companions—Epaphras (his fellow prisoner), Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke. The letter closes with Paul’s blessing: “May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.”"
        },
        {
            text: "This letter shows the heart of Christian forgiveness, love, and equality—teaching that in Christ, everyone, whether slave or free, is a brother or sister in God’s family."
