        heading: "King Hezekiah – The Faithful King Who Trusted God Completely",
        text: "King Hezekiah was one of the most righteous and faithful kings of Judah. He ruled in Jerusalem for 29 years, beginning at the age of 25. His story is told in 2 Kings 18–20, 2 Chronicles 29–32, and Isaiah 36–39. Unlike many kings before him, Hezekiah loved the Lord with all his heart, and the Bible says, “There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after him.”"

        heading: "Hezekiah’s Background",
        text: "Hezekiah was the son of King Ahaz, one of the most wicked kings Judah ever had. Ahaz had brought great sin into the land—he built altars to idols, closed the Temple of the Lord, and even sacrificed his own son in fire to false gods. Because of this, Judah had faced much trouble from enemies like Aram and Israel."

        heading: "Restoring the Temple",
        text: "But when Hezekiah became king, he decided to completely turn the nation back to God. The very first thing he did in the first month of his reign was to open the doors of the Temple of the Lord and repair them. He gathered the priests and Levites and said, “Listen to me, consecrate yourselves now, and consecrate the house of the Lord. Our fathers have been unfaithful; they have done evil in the eyes of the Lord and turned their faces away from Him. That is why God’s anger has come upon us. Now I intend to make a covenant with the Lord.”"

        heading: "Purifying the Temple",
        text: "Hezekiah led the priests to cleanse the Temple completely. They removed all the defiled things that Ahaz had brought in and restored everything according to God’s law. After eight days, the Temple was purified, and Hezekiah and all the people came to offer sacrifices of thanksgiving to the Lord. The worship and songs of praise began again, with cymbals, harps, and trumpets, just as in the days of David. The people rejoiced greatly because the worship of God had been restored after many years of darkness."

        heading: "Celebrating the Passover",
        text: "Hezekiah didn’t stop there. He wanted to restore true worship for the entire nation, not just Jerusalem. So he sent messengers all through Judah and even into the northern tribes of Israel, inviting everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover, which had not been celebrated properly for a long time. Many people in the northern kingdom laughed at the message and refused, but some humbled themselves and came. When the Passover began, there was great joy and unity among the people. Many who came were ceremonially unclean, but Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May the Lord, who is good, pardon everyone who sets his heart on seeking God.” The Lord heard Hezekiah’s prayer and healed the people. The festival lasted seven days, and then they decided to celebrate another seven days because of their great joy. It was one of the most joyful celebrations since the days of Solomon."

        heading: "Religious Reforms",
        text: "After the Passover, Hezekiah continued his reformation. He removed the high places, destroyed the sacred stones and Asherah poles, and even broke into pieces the bronze serpent that Moses had made in the wilderness, because people had begun to worship it instead of God. Hezekiah wanted Judah to worship only the Lord and follow His commands completely."

        heading: "Trusting in the Lord",
        text: "The Bible says, “Hezekiah trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel. He held fast to the Lord and did not stop following Him; he kept the commands the Lord had given to Moses. And the Lord was with him; he was successful in whatever he undertook.”"

        heading: "Threat from Assyria",
        text: "Hezekiah’s trust in God was soon tested when the powerful empire of Assyria threatened Judah. The Assyrian king Sennacherib had already conquered many nations, including the northern kingdom of Israel, and now he came against Judah. Hezekiah first tried to make peace by paying tribute. He gave Sennacherib all the silver from the Temple and even gold from its doors, but the Assyrian king still sent his army to conquer Jerusalem."

        heading: "Rabshakeh’s Mockery",
        text: "Sennacherib’s army surrounded Jerusalem, and his commander, called the Rabshakeh, shouted loudly in Hebrew so everyone could hear. He mocked Hezekiah and said, “Do not let Hezekiah deceive you. He cannot deliver you from my hand. Do not let him make you trust in the Lord, saying, ‘The Lord will deliver us.’ Has any god of any nation ever delivered his land from the king of Assyria?” He insulted the living God and tried to make the people lose hope."

        heading: "Hezekiah’s Prayer",
        text: "When Hezekiah heard the mocking words, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and went to the Temple to pray. He also sent his officials to the prophet Isaiah, asking him to pray for the nation. Isaiah sent back a message from the Lord: “Do not be afraid of the words you have heard. I will make the king of Assyria return to his own country, and he will fall by the sword there.”"

        heading: "Sennacherib’s Letter and God’s Deliverance",
        text: "Not long after, Sennacherib sent another threatening letter to Hezekiah, boasting of his victories and saying that no god had ever saved any nation from him. Hezekiah took the letter, went up to the Temple of the Lord, and spread it out before God. He prayed, “O Lord Almighty, God of Israel, enthroned between the cherubim, You alone are God over all the kingdoms of the earth. Incline Your ear, O Lord, and hear. Open Your eyes, O Lord, and see. Hear the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God. Now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hand so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that You alone are God.” God heard Hezekiah’s prayer and sent a powerful message through Isaiah: “The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and laughs at you. Whom have you insulted and blasphemed? You have raised your voice against the Holy One of Israel! Because you have raged against Me, I will put My hook in your nose and My bridle in your mouth and make you return the way you came.” That very night, the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 soldiers in the camp of the Assyrians. When the people woke up the next morning, all they saw were dead bodies. Sennacherib withdrew and returned to his own land, and later, while worshipping in the temple of his god, his own sons killed him with the sword—just as God had said."

        heading: "Hezekiah’s Illness and Prayer",
        text: "Later in his life, Hezekiah became very sick. The prophet Isaiah came to him and said, “Set your house in order, for you will die and not recover.” Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and wept bitterly, praying, “Remember, Lord, how I have walked before You faithfully and with wholehearted devotion.” Before Isaiah had even left the palace, God told him to go back and tell Hezekiah, “I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will heal you, and I will add fifteen years to your life. I will also deliver this city from the hand of the king of Assyria.” As a sign of His promise, God made the shadow on the sundial move backward ten steps, something that had never happened before. Hezekiah recovered from his illness, and as Isaiah instructed, a poultice of figs was placed on the boil that had made him sick."

        heading: "Hezekiah and Babylon",
        text: "However, sometime after his recovery, envoys from Babylon came to visit Hezekiah, bringing gifts and letters of congratulations. Hezekiah, feeling proud, showed them all the treasures of his kingdom—his silver, gold, spices, and armor. When Isaiah heard this, he asked what they had seen. Hezekiah said he had shown them everything. Then Isaiah gave a sad prophecy: “The time will come when everything in your palace, all that your fathers have stored up, will be carried off to Babylon. Some of your descendants will be taken away and become servants in the palace of the king of Babylon.” Hezekiah humbly accepted the word of the Lord and said, “The word of the Lord you have spoken is good,” for he thought there would be peace in his lifetime."

        heading: "Hezekiah’s Achievements and Death",
        text: "Despite this mistake, Hezekiah’s reign remained one of the most blessed and godly in Judah’s history. He built water tunnels and reservoirs, most famously the Siloam Tunnel, to bring water into Jerusalem in case of siege. He strengthened the city walls and led his people with courage and faith. When Hezekiah died, all of Judah honored him and buried him in the upper section of the royal tombs, and his son Manasseh succeeded him as king."
