And many <b>Jews</b> thought that this had already happened to Jesus.\n\nKing Herod was very afraid. He thought that God had made John the <b>Baptist</b> alive again. And so Herod believed that God was very angry with him. This was because Herod had caused John’s death.\n\nThis Herod was a son of the king who tried to kill the baby Jesus (Matthew 2:16). Like his father, this Herod was a cruel king.\n\nHerod had taken another man’s wife. John said that this was against God’s <b>law</b>. So Herod put John into a prison. But Herod did not want to hurt John.\n\nHerod’s wife was called Herodias. She was angry with John, and she wanted to kill him. But Herod would not let her.\n\nHerodias waited until Herod’s birthday. Herod had drunk much alcohol. And he wanted his visitors to think that he was a great king. But Herod was a fool. He made a promise to Herodias’s daughter. He should have never made that promise.\n\nThe daughter seems even worse than her mother was. She told Herod that she wanted John’s death. Herod should have refused. But he had made a promise. And his visitors had heard it. Herod did not want them to think that he was a fool. So he did the thing that Herodias’s daughter wanted. He sent a soldier to kill John."

He stayed with them for the whole day.\n\nBecause the people left so quickly, they had no food with them. But God gave them food. He gave even more food than the people needed.

They came to put seeds and oils on Jesus’ dead body. The <b>Jews</b> did this for two reasons:\n\n\t• They wanted to show love for the person who had died. So they chose seeds and oils that have a lovely smell.\n\n\t• They believed that God will cause dead people to live again (Mark 12:24-27). Those seeds and oils are like the seeds and oils that people use to keep foods good. The <b>Jews</b> wanted the dead body to be ready for the day when people will live again. They knew that their seeds and oils would not make a dead body ready to live again. But they still used the seeds and oils. And they remembered what God would do.\n\nThe women were trying to find someone who would roll the stone away. But they were very surprised when they reached the place. Pilate had sent soldiers there. But the soldiers had left. They had run away because they saw an <b>angel</b> (Matthew 27:4). The women had not seen the <b>angel</b> yet. But they saw that someone had already rolled the stone away.\n\nSo, the women went in. There, they found a young man. This young man was the <b>angel</b> (Matthew 28:2-5). His clothes were bright white. They were like Jesus’ clothes on the mountain (Mark 9:3). The women were very afraid of the <b>angel</b>.\n\nThe <b>angel</b> told them a message from God. The dead body was not there, because Jesus was alive. The women should tell the <b>disciples</b>. And they should tell Peter, too. Jesus was going to Galilee. They should meet him there.\n\nJesus had told them that this would happen (Mark 8:31; Mark 9:9; Mark 10:34). And he had told the <b>disciples</b> that they should meet him in Galilee (Mark 14:28). But they did not believe then. And they still did not believe. An <b>angel</b> had come from God to tell them this message. But the women did not go immediately to tell the message to the <b>disciples</b>. Instead, the women tried to run away. They said nothing about this event. They were too afraid."

            text: "Bible students do not think that Mark 16:8 is the end of Mark’s book. But the two best old copies of the book stop there. It is clear that the last page of the book became separate. And some people did not know what the end of the book should be.\n\nMark 16:9-20 may be Mark’s words. But today most Bible students think that someone else wrote it. But it may not matter who wrote it. That is because its report agrees with the reports of Matthew, Luke and John. And it agrees with the other parts of Mark’s book. All these books say that Jesus became alive again. They agree about the things that he told his <b>disciples</b>. And they agree about the things that happened after that.\n\nIf Mark did not write Mark 16:9-20, he wrote something like it. He had already written that Jesus became alive again after his death (Mark 8:31; Mark 9:9; Mark 10:34 and Mark 14:28). Mark had written that Jesus is the Christ (Mark 1:1; Mark 8:29). And Mark had written that Jesus is the son of God (Mark 1:11; Mark 9:8). Also, Mark had written that the <b>disciples</b> must tell God’s good news to people everywhere (Mark 4:22; Mark 10:29-30; Mark 13:10 and Mark 14:9). All these things are also in Mark 16:9-20.\n\nMark 16:9-20 includes another important idea that is also in Mark 16:1-8. Here is that idea. Even after Jesus was alive again, the <b>disciples</b> still did not believe. The book repeats that idea often (Mark 16:8; Mark 16:11; Mark 16:13 and Mark 16:14). The writer clearly thought that this was a very important fact.\n\nSo the writer of Mark 16:9-20 did not only want to tell people that Jesus is alive. He also wanted them to know that they must believe God. And that is also something that Mark writes often (Mark 1:15; Mark 2:5; Mark 5:34; Mark 8:12; Mark 9:23-24 and Mark 11:23-24)."

            text: "In the end, the <b>disciples</b> would not believe until they saw Jesus. But God wants people to believe even before they see those things (Hebrews 11:1-2). People should believe because God has given a promise (Hebrews 11:11-16). And God does not disappoint. He does everything that he has promised.\n\nSo, it is wrong not to believe God (Mark 6:6; Mark 9:19). It is wrong to refuse a message that God has sent (Mark 6:11).\n\nBut God is kind. He often gives people several chances to believe him. And in the end, he helped the <b>disciples</b> so that they could believe.\n\nAnd when they believed, Jesus had a special message for them. He gave them authority to continue the work that he had begun.\n\nJesus spoke these things to the 11 <b>disciples</b>. Judas was not there; he had killed himself (Matthew 27:5). But the other 11 <b>disciples</b> were all present. And they would tell very many people about God’s good news.\n\nThe things that Jesus said were not only for the 11 <b>disciples</b>. The <b>disciples</b> began this work, but they did not finish it. Christians are still doing this work. And they will continue to do it until Jesus returns. They must tell God’s good news to people everywhere.\n\nIt is good news. God will save those people who believe him. But it is also important news. People must not refuse God’s message.\n\nChristians are not alone when they speak God’s message. God’s <b>Holy</b> Spirit is with them. Sometimes the <b>Holy</b> Spirit will do powerful things to help them. And then other people will see that Christians really do have God’s authority.\n\nSo, Christians would cause bad <b>spirits</b> to leave people. That happened in Acts 16:18. Christians would speak languages that they had not learned. That happened in Acts 2:4-12. God would make Christians safe, even from snakes and poisons. That happened in Acts 28:3-6. And when Christians prayed, God would make ill people well. That happened in Acts 3:1-10; Acts 5:15-16 and Acts 14:8-10.\n\nThese things have not all stopped. God still does powerful things when Christians pray. He still works with his people. He still gives them the things that they need to do his work.\n\nBut Christians must never try to use God’s authority for their own purposes. And a Christian must not do dangerous things because he wants God to save him. So, an ill Christian may pray that God will make him well. But that Christian should also ask the doctor for help.\n\nGod wants his people to be careful. And he wants them to use his authority properly."
