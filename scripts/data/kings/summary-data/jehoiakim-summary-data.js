        heading: "King Jehoiakim – The Proud King Who Rebelled Against God’s Word",
        text: "King Jehoiakim was one of the last kings of Judah before the Babylonian exile. His story is told in 2 Kings 23:34–24:7, 2 Chronicles 36:5–8, and throughout the Book of Jeremiah. He was the son of King Josiah, one of Judah’s best and most faithful kings. But sadly, Jehoiakim’s life was the complete opposite of his father’s. While Josiah had loved God’s law and reformed the nation, Jehoiakim turned away from the Lord and led Judah back into sin, pride, and rebellion."

        heading: "Jehoiakim’s Rise to Power",
        text: "After King Josiah died in battle at Megiddo, the people of Judah made his younger son Jehoahaz king. But after only three months, the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho came and captured Jehoahaz, taking him as a prisoner to Egypt. Then Pharaoh Necho made Eliakim, Josiah’s other son, king in his brother’s place and changed his name to Jehoiakim, which means “The Lord raises up.” Pharaoh also demanded a heavy tribute from Judah — silver and gold that Jehoiakim had to collect from the people through taxes. From the very beginning of his reign, Jehoiakim was not a free king. He was under Egypt’s control and ruled only because Pharaoh allowed it."

        heading: "Jehoiakim’s Evil Reign",
        text: "Jehoiakim ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. But instead of following the good example of his father Josiah, the Bible says that he did evil in the sight of the Lord his God. He allowed idol worship, injustice, and corruption to spread again in Judah. He focused on his own comfort and power instead of caring for his people or honoring God. One of the things he did was build a luxurious palace for himself, decorated with cedar and painted in fine colors. He forced his people to work on it without fair pay, showing his pride and greed."

        heading: "Jeremiah’s Warnings Rejected",
        text: "During Jehoiakim’s reign, the prophet Jeremiah was very active. God sent Jeremiah to warn the king and the people that judgment was coming if they did not repent. Jeremiah told them that unless they turned away from idolatry and injustice, God would bring the Babylonians (also called the Chaldeans) to destroy Jerusalem and take the people captive. But Jehoiakim refused to listen. He mocked Jeremiah, hated his messages, and even tried to silence him."

    {
        heading: "The Burning of God’s Scroll",
        text: "One of the most shocking events in Jehoiakim’s story happened when Jeremiah wrote down God’s words in a scroll. God told Jeremiah to write all the warnings and prophecies He had spoken about Judah, from the days of Josiah until that time, so that the people might hear and repent. Jeremiah dictated the words to his helper Baruch, who wrote them carefully on a scroll. Later, Baruch went to the temple and read the scroll aloud to the people. When the officials heard it, they were frightened and decided to take it to the king."

    {
        heading: "Jehoiakim Burns the Scroll",
        text: "The officials read the scroll to Jehoiakim while he was sitting in his winter palace, warming himself by the fire. As the reader finished a few columns, the king cut the scroll with a knife and threw it into the fire, piece by piece, until the entire scroll was burned. He destroyed God’s word deliberately, showing his total disrespect and rebellion against the Lord. Even when some of his officials begged him not to burn it, he ignored them. He also ordered the arrest of Jeremiah and Baruch, but God protected them, and they were not found."

    {
        heading: "God’s Judgment on Jehoiakim",
        text: "After that, God told Jeremiah to write the same words again on a new scroll — and to add a message of judgment for Jehoiakim. The Lord said that because the king had burned His word, no one from his family line would sit securely on David’s throne, and that Jehoiakim’s own body would be thrown out and left unburied, exposed to the heat of day and the frost of night. This showed how much God disapproved of Jehoiakim’s pride and defiance."

    {
        heading: "Changing Political Powers",
        text: "During Jehoiakim’s time, the political situation in the region changed quickly. At first, he served Pharaoh Necho of Egypt. But later, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, defeated Egypt and became the new world power. When Nebuchadnezzar came to Judah, Jehoiakim submitted to him and became his servant for three years. But soon, Jehoiakim rebelled against Babylon too, thinking Egypt might help him regain freedom."

    {
        heading: "Judgment and Invasions",
        text: "This rebellion was a terrible mistake. As a result, God allowed bands of Babylonian, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders to attack Judah. These enemies destroyed towns, killed people, and weakened the nation. The Bible says this happened because God was determined to remove Judah from His presence because of their sins — especially the sins of King Manasseh, who had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood. But Jehoiakim made things even worse by continuing to ignore God’s prophets."

    {
        heading: "Jeremiah Condemns Jehoiakim’s Oppression",
        text: "Jeremiah also spoke directly against Jehoiakim’s greed and oppression. He said, “Woe to him who builds his house by unrighteousness, who makes his neighbor serve him without wages.” God compared Jehoiakim unfavorably to his father Josiah, saying that Josiah had cared for justice and the poor, while Jehoiakim only cared for luxury and power. The prophet warned that Jehoiakim would not be mourned like a noble king but would have the burial of a donkey — dragged out and thrown beyond the gates of Jerusalem."

    {
        heading: "Jehoiakim’s Death",
        text: "Jehoiakim’s end came suddenly. The Bible gives few details, but it suggests that he died violently. Either the Babylonians killed him during an invasion, or his own people may have turned against him. His body was likely thrown outside the city, just as Jeremiah had foretold. After his death, his son Jehoiachin (also called Jeconiah or Coniah) became king, but only for three months before Babylon captured him and carried him away into exile."

    {
        heading: "Legacy of Pride and Rebellion",
        text: "King Jehoiakim’s reign is remembered as one of pride, cruelty, and rebellion against God’s word. He had the privilege of being the son of a godly king and hearing clear warnings from a true prophet, but he chose to despise both. He trusted in wealth, power, and foreign alliances instead of humbling himself before God."

    {
        heading: "The Lesson from Jehoiakim’s Life",
        text: "His story teaches us a serious lesson — that rejecting God’s word leads to ruin. Jehoiakim thought he could silence God by burning the scroll, but God’s word cannot be destroyed. The same message was rewritten, and God’s judgment came exactly as He said. Jehoiakim’s proud heart, refusal to listen, and disrespect for God brought destruction not only on himself but on his entire nation."

    {
        heading: "Final Reflection",
        text: "King Jehoiakim’s life reminds us that no one can escape the truth of God’s word. We can either humbly accept it and find mercy, or reject it and face judgment. Jehoiakim chose rebellion — and his story ended in disgrace, paving the way for the final fall of Judah and the captivity in Babylon."
