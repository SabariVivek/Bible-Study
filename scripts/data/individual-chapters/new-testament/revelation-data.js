Jesus spoke to John by means of an <b>angel</b>. The word ‘revelation’ means that which God now shows. No person could know these things unless God showed them. God gave this <b>revelation</b> to Jesus Christ. Only God knows the future and he gave this knowledge to Jesus. This is the message that Jesus gives to John. That message shows us many things about Jesus. We see more of his <b>glory</b>. We read how he will defeat <b>Satan</b> and his evil plans. John tells us about the time when Jesus will come. We see Jesus as the king of kings. He will rule on earth and in heaven. But the main purpose is to show us the things that must happen soon. Many of the things that must happen soon are still in the future. The word ‘soon’ can mean quickly or without delay. When the time comes, these things will happen. Some things in the book have already happened. Other things in the book have not yet started to happen. <b>Prophecy</b> tends to speak as if the end is ready to happen. It seems to forget the time between now and then. People should be aware that these things could happen at any time. So, they need always to be ready. The <b>angel</b> did not show these things to John in plain speech. John saw and heard strange things as in dreams. But he was not asleep. He writes about these for us as descriptions. We need to understand these descriptions in order to understand the book."

And Jesus Christ is a witness that this message is the word of God. In chapter 21:5 God said, ‘I am making all things new.’ Then he said, ‘Write this. What I am saying is true. You can believe it.’ In chapter 22:6 the <b>angel</b> said, ‘You can trust these words. They are true. The <b>Lord</b> God, who gives his Spirit to the <b>prophets</b>, sent his <b>angel</b> to you. God sent his <b>angel</b> to show his (God’s) servants what must happen quickly.’ John actually saw all that he has written here. The <b>angel</b> of the <b>Lord</b> showed all these things to John.

So he was probably a leader in the <b>churches</b> in Asia. He writes to 7 actual <b>churches</b>. They were in Asia. This was part of the country that we now call Turkey. At that time, the <b>Romans</b> ruled over Asia. These 7 were not the only <b>churches</b> in Asia. In the Bible, the number 7 sometimes means the complete or perfect number. The <b>Lord</b> chose these as typical of the whole <b>church</b>. The problems that these <b>churches</b> had are like the problems of the <b>church</b> in all ages. The messages were to those actual <b>churches</b> and to the whole <b>church</b>. The order of the <b>churches</b> is the same as the main routes through the area. If someone starts a journey in Ephesus, the road north goes through Smyrna to Pergamum. Then the road to the south and east goes through Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia and it ends in Laodicea. John starts with the usual form of greeting. He prays that God would be kind to them. He asks God to give them calm hearts. He prays to God in three persons. In this verse, there is God the Father and the Spirit. In the next verse, he includes Jesus Christ. God met with Moses in the desert. Moses asked God for his name. God said, ‘I am who I am’ (Exodus 3:14). God always is. He was there before he made time. He will be there after time has finished. God did not have a start. And he will not have an end. This is God the Father. The 7 spirits that are in front of the <b>throne</b> are the Holy Spirit. The 7 spirits show the work of Christ by the Holy Spirit in the 7 <b>churches</b>."

He then describes Jesus in three phrases.\n\t• Jesus is the true witness.\n\t• He is the first person to be born again from death.\n\t• He is the ruler of the kings of the earth.\n‘Jesus is the true witness.’ So, Jesus says that the message of this book is true. He received it from God. Then, Jesus showed it to John. And Jesus told John to write it to the <b>churches</b>. But the phrase means much more than this. Jesus was the true witness to God when he lived on earth. He showed us what God is like. He taught what God has said. He did all that God asked him to do. We can know God only because of Jesus. Jesus was the true witness even through death. He is the model for the <b>churches</b>. They have troubles because they belong to Jesus. Many Christians will have to die because they speak for Jesus. Jesus was born again from death. God the Father raised him from death to life again. He is the first to be born from death. This does not just mean that he was the first in time. He is the first in importance. He now has power over death and the place of dead people (1:18). That Jesus is the first to be born from death should encourage us. He has the power to raise people to life after death. He has promised to do this for all who believe in him. He is the first person and the leader of a great crowd of people. These will follow him through death. He will lead his people into new life. He will bring them out of the place of dead people. Strong nations rule on the earth. Rome was then the strongest nation. They ruled all the nations round about them. But Jesus is the ruler of the kings of the earth. They can only rule if Jesus allows them. We may not see it now but Jesus is in control. He has all power in heaven and on earth. He is the king of kings. He is the <b>Lord</b> of all. One day Jesus will return to the earth. Then he will defeat all his enemies. And he will rule all the nations. Although he is so great, Christ loves us. His love for us is a continuous fact. He has always loved us. And he will always love us. Because of his love, he died for us. By that death, he made us free from our <b>sins</b>. Through all their troubles, Christ cares for his people. They can depend on his love. He will be with them whatever happens."

They are the priests. The first task of the priest is to praise and to thank God. The priest is the agent of the people. He comes to God on their behalf. He is also the agent of God to the people. As priests, Christians should pray for the people that the <b>Lord</b> will be kind to them. As priests, Christians are witnesses to the world about what God has done.

So, the devil will put them in prison.\n\nHowever, the *Lord says, ‘Do not be afraid.’ Jesus told his friends not to be afraid of those who could kill the body. They cannot kill the person’s spirit, which lives in the body. Rather we should be afraid of God who can punish the whole person, both body and spirit (Matthew 10:28).\n\nTo those who overcome, Jesus will give life as a crown. The reward, like a crown, is life itself. This crown is the sort that the winner in a race receives. They had races in Smyrna. This life is like a race. Those who win the race will receive the prize.

The <b>Lord</b> Jesus calls himself the loyal and true witness. What he says is always true. He speaks what he knows. He talks about what he sees. We can believe all that he says.

They were about what happened on the earth. With the fifth <b>seal</b>, the events moved from earth to heaven.\n\nThe <b>Lord</b> Jesus opened the fifth <b>seal</b>. John saw an <b>altar</b> in heaven. Under the <b>altar</b> there were the <b>souls</b> of those who had died. These people died because they believed in the <b>Lord</b>. They believed the word of God. They had been good servants of God.\n\nJohn speaks about these <b>souls</b> being under the <b>altar</b>. When a priest made a <b>sacrifice</b>, he poured out the blood below the <b>altar</b>. The idea here is that these people were like a <b>sacrifice</b>. They were as a <b>sacrifice</b> made to God. In fact, they died on earth. But by their death, they offered their <b>souls</b> on the <b>altar</b> in heaven.\n\nThey spoke to the <b>Lord</b> because he has all authority. The <b>Lord</b> is holy. And he will do what is right. In the end, he must punish all evil actions. The <b>Lord</b> will punish the people who had caused their deaths. They knew this. These <b>souls</b> asked the <b>Lord</b> a question. They were asking, ‘How long must we wait? When will you punish those who caused our deaths?’\n\nThe clear answer was that the situation will become worse first. But, at the time when God chooses, he will answer their prayer. He will show his anger against the people who do not believe in him. That day of God’s anger will come upon the earth.\n\nTo each of these <b>souls</b>, the <b>Lord</b> gave white clothes. These clothes showed that they were clean from all <b>sin</b>. In other words, God accepted them as innocent. And he gave them honour. These <b>souls</b> under the <b>altar</b> were at rest.\n\nGod told them to be patient. They must wait a little time. People on the earth would kill more of God’s people. Then the time will come and God will act."

The light could not shine through it. The day became as the night. The moon glowed a deep red colour. It was the colour of blood.\n\nPeter spoke about this event (Acts 2:20). He used the words of Joel the <b>prophet</b> (Joel 2:30). He said, ‘the sun will become darkness. The moon will become blood.’ This would happen before the great and terrible day of the <b>Lord</b> comes.\n\nIt seemed as if the stars fell down to the earth.

They believed that the stars would fall from the sky. When this happened, the end of the world would come.\n\nThe sky disappeared as if God had rolled it up. The mountains and islands moved.\n\nStars cannot fall to the earth. The sky cannot disappear like a <b>scroll</b>. This is the language of poetry. It shows how awful these events will be. They will come before the <b>Lord</b> returns to the earth. But it is not just poetry. It tells about real events that will happen in the skies.\n\nAt these terrible events, all the people on earth were afraid. They cried out in terror. They tried to hide from God and from the <b>Lord</b> Jesus. They tried to escape from the anger of God and of the <b>Lamb</b>. They would rather die than meet with God.\n\nIn the end, there will be no place to hide. All will have to meet with God. And, in that day, God will be their judge. This will be the day of God’s anger. And the <b>Lamb</b> will be angry with all those who are on the earth. Nobody will be able to escape from the fierce anger of God and of the <b>Lamb</b>."
