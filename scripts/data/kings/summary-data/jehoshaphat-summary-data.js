        text: "King Jehoshaphat was the fourth king of Judah, the son of King Asa, and he ruled after his father’s death. His story is found mainly in 1 Kings 22 and 2 Chronicles 17–20. He ruled for twenty-five years in Jerusalem and was remembered as a good and godly king who followed the Lord, just like his father Asa had done in his early years. Jehoshaphat’s reign was marked by faith in God, peace, prosperity, and one of the most amazing victories ever won without fighting a battle."

        text: "When Jehoshaphat became king, the kingdom of Judah was still facing challenges from its neighboring nations and from idol worship that had spread through the land. But Jehoshaphat had a heart that truly sought after God. The Bible says, “He walked in the ways of his father David, and did not seek the Baals, but sought the God of his father and walked in His commandments.”"

        heading: "Jehoshaphat’s Reforms and Teaching the Law",
        text: "One of the first things Jehoshaphat did was remove the idols from Judah. He destroyed the altars and high places used for idol worship, and he encouraged his people to worship the true God of Israel. But he didn’t stop there—he wanted the people to know God’s Word personally. So, in the third year of his reign, he did something very wise and unique: he sent out teachers and Levites throughout all the towns of Judah with the Book of the Law of the Lord. They went from village to village teaching the people about God’s laws and commandments. This was one of the earliest forms of organized Bible teaching in Israel’s history."

        heading: "Peace and Prosperity in Judah",
        text: "Because Jehoshaphat led his people to fear the Lord, God protected Judah from enemies. The Bible says that “the fear of the Lord fell on all the kingdoms around Judah,” and no one dared to make war against him. Even the Philistines and Arabians brought him gifts and tribute, showing how respected and powerful he had become."

        heading: "Jehoshaphat’s Leadership and Justice System",
        text: "Jehoshaphat also built strong fortresses and store cities in Judah. He organized his army well, and Judah became strong both spiritually and militarily. He placed trustworthy judges throughout the land to ensure justice was done according to God’s law. When he appointed the judges, he told them, “Consider carefully what you do, because you are not judging for man but for the Lord, who is with you whenever you give a verdict.” This showed that Jehoshaphat wanted justice, righteousness, and fairness in his kingdom."

        heading: "Jehoshaphat’s Alliance with Ahab",
        text: "However, Jehoshaphat made one serious mistake. He formed an alliance with King Ahab of Israel, who was one of the most wicked kings in the northern kingdom. To strengthen this alliance, Jehoshaphat’s son Jehoram married Ahab’s daughter Athaliah, which later caused much trouble for Judah."

        heading: "The Battle of Ramoth-Gilead",
        text: "One day, Ahab invited Jehoshaphat to join him in a war against the Arameans at Ramoth-Gilead. Jehoshaphat agreed to go with him but asked first that they inquire of the Lord. Ahab brought four hundred prophets, but they all falsely said that God would give them victory. Jehoshaphat was not satisfied and asked, “Is there not a prophet of the Lord here whom we can ask?” Ahab reluctantly called Micaiah, a true prophet of God. Micaiah warned that the battle would end in disaster and that Ahab would die."

        heading: "Jehoshaphat’s Narrow Escape",
        text: "Despite this warning, Jehoshaphat still went into battle with Ahab. During the fight, Ahab disguised himself as a soldier, but Jehoshaphat wore his royal robes. When the Aramean soldiers saw Jehoshaphat, they thought he was Ahab and surrounded him. Jehoshaphat cried out to the Lord, and God helped him, turning the enemies away from him. Ahab, however, was killed by a random arrow that struck him between his armor plates—just as God had foretold."

        heading: "God’s Rebuke Through Jehu",
        text: "When Jehoshaphat returned home safely, a prophet named Jehu son of Hanani came to him and said, “Should you help the wicked and love those who hate the Lord? Because of this, the wrath of the Lord is upon you. Nevertheless, there is some good in you, for you have removed the idols and set your heart to seek God.” Jehoshaphat took this rebuke seriously and continued to strengthen Judah in the right way."

        heading: "The Threat from Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir",
        text: "Later in his reign came one of the most dramatic events in his life. A vast army from Moab, Ammon, and Mount Seir came together to attack Judah. When Jehoshaphat heard the news, he was afraid—but instead of relying on his army, he turned immediately to God in prayer. He called all the people of Judah to fast and pray together. From the youngest to the oldest, everyone gathered at the temple in Jerusalem to seek the Lord."

    {
        heading: "Jehoshaphat’s Prayer",
        text: "Jehoshaphat stood before the people and prayed a humble, powerful prayer: “O Lord, the God of our fathers, are You not the God who is in heaven? You rule over all kingdoms of the nations. Power and might are in Your hand, and no one can withstand You… We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on You.”"

        heading: "God’s Answer Through Jahaziel",
        text: "After this prayer, the Spirit of the Lord came upon a man named Jahaziel, who was a Levite. He gave a message from God saying, “Do not be afraid or discouraged because of this vast army. For the battle is not yours, but God’s. Tomorrow go out against them, and you will not have to fight. Stand still and see the salvation of the Lord.”"

        heading: "Victory Without a Battle",
        text: "The next morning, Jehoshaphat gathered his army, and instead of sending soldiers first, he sent singers ahead to praise God, singing, “Give thanks to the Lord, for His mercy endures forever.” As they sang, God caused confusion among the enemy armies. The Moabites and Ammonites turned against the people of Mount Seir, and then they turned against each other until every enemy was destroyed. When Judah reached the battlefield, they found nothing but dead bodies—not one enemy had survived."

        text: "Jehoshaphat and his people spent three days collecting the enormous amount of spoil—gold, silver, and goods left behind. On the fourth day, they gathered in the Valley of Berakah (which means “Blessing”) to praise the Lord for His great deliverance."

    {
        heading: "Peace and Final Years",
        text: "After this event, the fear of God fell on all the surrounding nations again, and no one dared to attack Judah. Jehoshaphat’s kingdom remained peaceful and strong for the rest of his life. However, later he made another poor alliance—this time with Ahaziah, the wicked son of Ahab, to build ships together for trade. God was displeased and destroyed the ships before they could sail."

        heading: "Lessons from Jehoshaphat’s Life",
        text: "King Jehoshaphat’s life teaches us many lessons: that trusting God brings victory, that true leadership means guiding people in righteousness, and that even good people must be careful whom they join with. His prayer “We do not know what to do, but our eyes are on You” remains one of the most beautiful prayers of faith in the entire Bible—a reminder that no matter how great the problem, God fights for those who depend on Him completely."
