    "verse_1": "This letter is from me, Paul. God chose me to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. Our Christian friend Timothy is here with me as I write. I am sending this letter to you, the people of the church in Corinth city. I am sending it also to all of God's people who live in other places in Achaia.",
    "verse_2": "I pray that God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ will continue to help you. I pray that they will give you peace in your minds.",
    "verse_3": "We thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, because he is so good to us. As our Father, he is very kind to us. He is our God who comforts us in every way.",
    "verse_4": "Whenever we have trouble, he comforts us. Because of that, we ourselves can comfort other people. When they have any kind of trouble, we can comfort them, in the same way that God has comforted us.",
    "verse_5": "Christ himself received much pain, and God comforted him. As Christ's servants, we also receive the same kind of pain. But, God also comforts us very much, because we belong to Christ.",
    "verse_6": "So, when we receive trouble, the result is that we can comfort you. And then also, God saves you. When God comforts us, that helps us to comfort you too. As a result, when you receive the same kinds of trouble that we receive, you learn to be patient and strong.",
    "verse_7": "So we continue to be sure that you will remain strong. You receive many troubles, as we do too. But we know that God will also comfort you, as he comforts us.",
    "verse_8": "Our Christian friends, we want you to know about the trouble that we had in Asia. Those troubles were very painful. We ourselves were not strong enough to continue. We even thought that we would die.",
    "verse_9": "We ourselves thought that we would certainly die. We knew that we could not trust our own strength. We had to trust God. He is the one who causes dead people to rise up to new life. So we could trust him to make us strong.",
    "verse_10": "We nearly died, but God saved us from that great danger. We know that we can continue to trust him. He will save us from any future danger.",
    "verse_11": "We also know that you continue to help us as you pray for us. As many people pray for us, they will thank God when he answers their prayers. They will see that God is very kind to us, and they will thank him.",
    "verse_12": "We can be proud of how we have lived in this world. We have been careful to be honest and good with everyone. And we have been like that with you even more. We are sure in our own minds that this is true. We have not tried to be clever in a human way. But we have lived in the way that God has helped us to live.",
    "verse_13": "We are writing to you only about things that you yourselves can read and understand. And I hope that you will understand completely one day.",
    "verse_14": "You do not understand us completely yet. But I hope that you will understand completely on the day when our Lord Jesus returns. Then you can be proud of us in the same way that we will be proud of you.",
    "verse_17": "I did not decide this in a careless way. I really wanted to do it. I do not decide to do things only to please myself, like someone who does not know God. I do not say ‘Yes,’ and then I immediately say ‘No’.",
    "verse_18": "God always does what he says he will do. In the same way, my promise to you was not both ‘Yes’ and ‘No’.",
    "verse_19": "Silas, Timothy and I told you the message about God's Son, Jesus Christ. Christ is not someone who changes his message between ‘Yes’ and ‘No’. Instead, he always says ‘Yes,’ and he does what he says.",
    "verse_20": "Christ says ‘Yes’ to all of God's promises, so that they become true. So when we pray, we say ‘Yes, amen!,’ because we know that Christ has done it. And when we do that, we are saying that God is great.",
    "verse_21": "It is God that causes us to continue to trust Christ. He does that for us and for you, because we belong to Christ. God has chosen us to serve him.",
    "verse_22": "He has also put his mark on us, to show that we belong to him. He has given his Spirit to us, to live in us. Because of that, we know that we will receive all the good things that God has promised.",
    "verse_23": "God will show that what I say is true! He knows my thoughts. Why did I decide not to come back to Corinth at this time? I did not come because I did not want to be angry with you.",
    "verse_24": "We are not trying to tell you what you must believe, like masters would do. You are already strong in your spirits because you trust God. So we want to help you to be really happy."
  },
  "chapter_2": {
    "verse_1": "Because of that, I decided not to visit you again at that time. I did not want to make you sad.",
    "verse_2": "You are the only people who can make me happy. So, if I make you sad, there will be nobody to make me happy.",
    "verse_3": "That is why I did not visit you. I wrote that letter to you instead. You are the people who should make me happy. I did not want you to make me sad when I visited you. I felt sure about all of you. I knew that, if I was happy, then all of you would be happy too.",
    "verse_4": "When I wrote that letter, I was very sad and upset. I cried a lot. I did not want to make you sad. Instead, I wanted you to know that I love you very much.",
    "verse_5": "Someone among you has done things that have made other people sad. That person has made me sad. But really he has made all of you much more sad than me. I do not want to say more about this than is necessary.",
    "verse_6": "Most of you have agreed to punish him. That should be enough.",
    "verse_7": "Now, you should forgive him. You should comfort him. If you do not do that, he may become too sad. He may not be able to think properly.",
    "verse_8": "So I tell you this: Please show him that you really do love him.",
    "verse_9": "When I wrote that letter to you, I wanted to know what you would do. I wanted to see if you would do everything that I told you.",
    "verse_10": "When you forgive anyone, I also forgive that person. Whatever bad thing somebody has done, I have Christ's authority to forgive them. And I do it to help you.",
    "verse_11": "We do not want Satan to win against us. He is very clever. We know how he likes to cause us to have trouble.",
    "verse_12": "I went to Troas city to tell people the good news about Christ. When I arrived there, I discovered that the Lord had already prepared people to listen.",
    "verse_13": "But I was not happy in my thoughts because I could not find my friend Titus there. So I said ‘goodbye’ to those people and I travelled on to Macedonia.",
    "verse_14": "But I thank God! He has won against sin, because of what Christ has done. Christ is our leader and we show that he is the winner. We also help people to know about Christ. That knowledge is like a lovely smell that comes to people everywhere.",
    "verse_15": "When we tell people about Christ, we are like a lovely smell that rises up to God. We are like that among the people that God is saving. We are also like that among the people who are dying because they are far from God.",
    "verse_16": "For the people who are dying, we are like a bad smell that brings a message of death. But for the people that God is saving, we are like a lovely smell that brings a message of new life. Nobody is really good enough to tell such an important message!",
    "verse_17": "Some people even tell God's message because they want to get a lot of money for themselves. But we are not like them. No, God himself has sent us to do this work. And he sees what we are doing. So we are honest and we speak God's message clearly, as Christ's servants should do."
  },
  "chapter_3": {
    "verse_1": "We do not need any more to show that our work is good. Some people need to have letters from other people to say that they do good work. We do not need to show you letters like that. Nor do we need you to write a letter like that for us.",
    "verse_2": "You yourselves show that we have done good work. You are like a letter that is written on our lives. Everybody can read that letter and they can understand it.",
    "verse_3": "It is clear that you are a like a letter that Christ himself has written. We are the people who brought God's message to you. Now people see what God has done in your lives. That is like a letter that they read. But it is not a letter written on paper with ink. It is the Spirit of the living God who wrote it. He did not write it on pieces of stone. Instead, he wrote it deep inside you.",
    "verse_4": "We know that these things are true. Because of what Christ has done, we trust God to help us.",
    "verse_5": "We know that we cannot do this work by ourselves. We never think that. But God makes us able to do it.",
    "verse_6": "God has made us his servants. So we are able to tell people the message of his new agreement. This new agreement is not about rules. Rules tell people what they must do and they bring death. But God's new agreement comes from his Spirit. And the Spirit brings new life to us, not death.",
    "verse_7": "Moses wrote the words of the old agreement on pieces of stone. It showed how great and powerful God was. Moses' face shone brightly after God spoke to him. It did not stay bright, but the Israelite people still could not look at Moses' face. The old agreement that brought death was powerful.",
    "verse_8": "So the new agreement, which comes from God's Spirit, will show the power of God even more.",
    "verse_9": "The old agreement showed people that they were guilty. God's new agreement makes people right with him. So surely the new agreement shows God's power even more than the old one did!",
    "verse_10": "The old agreement was great and powerful at one time. But now God's new agreement has come in its place. The great power of the new agreement shows that the old agreement is no longer powerful.",
    "verse_11": "The old agreement was powerful, but it came to an end. God's new agreement will continue always. So it surely shows the power of God even more!",
    "verse_12": "So, because we know all this, we speak God's message bravely.",
    "verse_13": "We are not like Moses. His face did not continue to be bright with the light from God. So he covered his face with a cloth. He did not want the Israelite people to see that the light was coming to an end.",
    "verse_14": "But those Israelite people could not think properly. Even today, they still do not understand the message of God's old agreement. When they read it, they are like people who have a cloth that covers their minds. It continues like that unless they believe in Christ. Then Christ removes the cloth so that they understand.",
    "verse_15": "Even today, when the Israelite people read Moses' books, a cloth still covers their minds.",
    "verse_16": "But when a person turns to trust the Lord, then God takes the cloth away.",
    "verse_17": "The Lord is the same as the Spirit. And when the Lord's Spirit is with anyone, that person is free.",
    "verse_18": "We show the power of the Lord to other people. It is like God has removed a cloth from over our faces. He is changing us so that we become more and more like him. We show how great God is more and more clearly. It is the Lord who does all this, by the work of his Spirit."
  },
  "chapter_4": {
    "verse_1": "God has given us this work to speak his message. Because he has been so kind to us, we are not afraid to continue.",
    "verse_2": "We refuse to do anything secretly that we might be ashamed of. We do not tell lies. We do not change God's message to deceive people. No. We tell God's true message clearly. God himself sees that we teach people in an honest way. Everyone should understand that we only do what is right.",
    "verse_3": "Some people may not understand the good news that we speak. They are only the people who are losing their lives with God.",
    "verse_4": "Those people do not accept God's good news. The god of this world has confused their minds. They cannot see the light that the good news brings. That message teaches about the great power of Christ, who shows us exactly what God is like.",
    "verse_5": "We do not speak a message about ourselves. We tell people that Jesus Christ is our Lord. Because we belong to Jesus, we have become your servants, not your masters.",
    "verse_6": "God is the one who said, ‘Let light shine in the dark.’ And he is the one who has caused his light to shine deep inside us. Because of that, we know how great and powerful God is. We see that his power shines brightly in Christ's face.",
    "verse_7": "God has given to us the gift to speak his message. But we ourselves are very weak. It is like we are keeping his valuable gift in clay pots. So it is clear that the great power of God's message comes from God himself. It does not come from us.",
    "verse_8": "We receive trouble all the time, but that does not stop us. We do not always know what to do, but we are not afraid to continue.",
    "verse_9": "We have many enemies, but we always have friends. People hurt us, but they never destroy us.",
    "verse_10": "As we serve Jesus, we know that we may die as he died. Because of that, our lives show that we live because he is alive.",
    "verse_11": "Yes, as we live our lives, death is always very near, because we serve Jesus. As a result, people can see in our weak, human bodies that Jesus is alive.",
    "verse_12": "So death is near to us, even as we live. But as a result, we are bringing God's life to you.",
    "verse_13": "This is written in the Bible: ‘I believed in God, and so I spoke.’ We also have the same kind of faith in God. So we also speak God's message, because we believe in him.",
    "verse_14": "God raised up the Lord Jesus, to become alive again after his death. Because we belong to Jesus, we know that God will also raise us up after we die. Together with you, God will take us to be where he is.",
    "verse_15": "In everything that we do, we want to help you. As a result, more and more people are seeing how kind God is. So people are thanking God more and more. And that shows how great God is.",
    "verse_16": "That is why we are not afraid to continue our work. Yes, our bodies are getting older and weaker. But our spirits are becoming stronger every day!",
    "verse_17": "We have these little troubles that continue for a short time. But as a result, we will receive the great things that God has prepared for us. Those great things are much more important than our little troubles. And God's great things will continue for ever!",
    "verse_18": "So we do not look at the things that we can see in this world. Instead, we look at the things that people cannot see. The things that we can see are only here for a short time. But the things that we cannot see will continue for ever."
  },
  "chapter_5": {
    "verse_1": "Our bodies are like a tent that we live in here on earth. One day, that home will come to an end. But we know that God will give us a new home. It is not a house that a human builder has built. God has built it for us in heaven and we will live there for ever.",
    "verse_2": "Now, while we are in our body here on earth, we cry inside ourselves. We want to go and live in our house that is in heaven.",
    "verse_3": "That will be like new clothes that we put on. When we go to live there, we will not be without clothes and ashamed.",
    "verse_4": "While we still live in our bodies here on earth, we cry inside ourselves. Many difficult things happen to us. We do not really want to take off our old body. But we do want to put on our new body, like new clothes. When that happens, we will no longer need our old body which had to die. Instead we will have a new body that will live for ever.",
    "verse_5": "God is the one who has prepared us to have a new life in heaven one day. He has given his Spirit to be with us now. Because of that, we know that we will receive all God's good things one day.",
    "verse_6": "Because God's Spirit is with us, we continue to be brave. While we still live here on earth, we know that we are not yet at home with the Lord.",
    "verse_7": "As we live here, we have to trust God. We do not yet see the things that belong to heaven.",
    "verse_8": "We are brave because we trust God. We would like to go away from our body here on earth. Then we would go to be at home with the Lord. And that would be better!",
    "verse_9": "But all the time we want to please the Lord. We want to do that while we are still at home in our body here on earth. We also want to please him when we go away from these bodies.",
    "verse_10": "Because all of us must go and stand in front of Christ as our judge. He will decide about the things that we have done during our lives here on earth. Whether we have done good things or bad things, we will receive what is right for us.",
    "verse_11": "We know that the Lord will judge us, so we are careful to obey him. Because of that, we tell God's message to people. We want them to believe in God. And God himself knows that we try to do what is right. I hope that you know that also, when you think about it.",
    "verse_12": "We are not trying again to make you think that our work is good. But we do want to give you the chance to be proud of us. Then you will be able to show the false teachers that they are wrong. They are proud about what they look like on the outside. They do not think about what they are really like inside themselves.",
    "verse_13": "To some people, we may seem to be crazy. That is because we want to serve God. But if we seem to be wise, that is to help you.",
    "verse_14": "Whatever we do, we do it because Christ loves us. We know that one man, Christ, died on behalf of all people. So we also know that all of us died with him.",
    "verse_15": "He died on behalf of all people. So, while we live, we no longer live to please ourselves. Instead, we live to please Christ. He is the one that died on our behalf. He is the one that God raised up, to live again.",
    "verse_16": "So that changes how we think about people. We no longer use human ideas to think what they are like. At one time, we thought about Christ as humans think. But now we think about him very differently!",
    "verse_17": "When anyone belongs to Christ, they become a new person. Their old way of life has gone. Their new life has begun!",
    "verse_18": "All this is what God does for us. Because of what Christ has done, God has brought us back to himself, as his friends. Now he wants us to bring other people to be his friends too. That is the job that he has given to us.",
    "verse_19": "God's message is this: By Christ's death, God was bringing people of the world back to himself, as his friends. He would no longer keep their sins in his thoughts. This is the message that God wants us to tell people.",
    "verse_20": "So we speak to people on behalf of Christ. It is like this: When we speak, God himself is speaking to you. On behalf of Christ, we say to you, ‘Please come back to God, as his friends!’",
    "verse_21": "Christ never did any wrong thing, but God punished him as if he had. He died as punishment for our sins. As a result, we become right with God when we belong to Christ. We become right, because he is right."
  },
  "chapter_6": {
    "verse_1": "So, as we work together with God, we tell you to be careful. Remember that God has been very kind and he has forgiven you. Do not waste that!",
    "verse_2": "In the Bible God says: ‘I listened to your prayer at the right time for me to help you. I helped you on the right day for me to save you.’ Listen! The right time is now! The day for God to save you is now!",
    "verse_3": "We do not want anyone to think bad things about our work. So we do nothing that might cause trouble for anyone.",
    "verse_4": "Instead, in everything that we do, we want to show that we are God's servants. When people want to hurt us, we are patient and brave. We have many troubles. We become sad and upset.",
    "verse_5": "Sometimes people hit us. They put us in prison. They attack us. But we work hard. We cannot always sleep at night. We are often hungry.",
    "verse_6": "We serve God honestly and with clean thoughts. We know what is true. We are patient and kind. God's Holy Spirit helps us. We love people in an honest way.",
    "verse_7": "We speak a true message. God's power gives us strength. We do what is right, so we fight like soldiers on God's behalf. It is like we have God's weapons in both hands!",
    "verse_8": "Sometimes people respect us as important. Sometimes they think that we are worth nothing. People may insult us, or they may praise us. We only say true things, but some people still think that we deceive others.",
    "verse_9": "Some people do not want to know us. Other people accept us as God's servants. It seems like we are dying, but look! We are still alive! People punish us, but they do not kill us.",
    "verse_10": "We seem to be sad, but really we are always happy. We seem to be poor, but we make many people rich. We seem to have nothing, but really we have everything.",
    "verse_11": "Our friends at Corinth, we have spoken to you very honestly. We have shown you how much we love you.",
    "verse_12": "We have done nothing to stop you from being our friends. But you have not really wanted to become our friends.",
    "verse_13": "I am speaking to you as I would speak to my own children. Be fair to us! Accept us as your friends, just as we have accepted you.",
    "verse_14": "Do not become united with people who do not believe in Christ. God has made you right with himself. Right and wrong cannot work together. Light and dark cannot join together.",
    "verse_15": "Christ will never agree with the Devil. People who believe in Christ are completely different from people who do not believe.",
    "verse_16": "Idols do not belong in God's house. Remember that we believers are the house of the God who lives for ever. This is what God has said: ‘I will make my home with them and I will live among them. I will be their God and they will be my people.’",
    "verse_17": "And so, the Lord says: ‘Come out from among them and be separate. Do not touch anything that is disgusting. Then I will accept you.’",
    "verse_18": "He also says: ‘I will be a Father to you. You will be my sons and my daughters. That is what the Almighty Lord God says.’"
  },
  "chapter_7": {
    "verse_1": "So, my friends, God has promised these things to us. So we must keep ourselves clean from everything that makes our bodies or our spirits unclean. We must respect and obey God. Then we will become more and more like him.",
    "verse_2": "Be friends with us. We have done nothing wrong to any of you. We have not hurt anyone. We have not cheated anyone.",
    "verse_3": "I am not saying this to make you feel ashamed. As I have told you before, you are our special friends. We will continue to love you, whether we live together or we die together.",
    "verse_4": "I know you and I trust you. I am proud of you. You have helped me to be strong. So, even when we have many troubles, I am still very happy.",
    "verse_5": "When we arrived in Macedonia, our bodies did not rest at all. We had many kinds of trouble. All round us, people quarrelled with us. Inside us, we were afraid.",
    "verse_6": "But when people feel upset, God helps them to be strong. And God made us happy when Titus arrived.",
    "verse_7": "God comforted us not only because Titus came to us. He comforted us also by what Titus told us about you. He said that you had helped him to be strong. He told us that you want to see me. He told us that you are very sad about what happened. He told us also that you are ready to help me. Because of what Titus told us about you, I was very happy.",
    "verse_8": "But even if I made you sad by my letter, I am not sorry about that. At one time, I was sorry that I had written it. I saw that my letter had made you sad. But you were sad only for a short time.",
    "verse_9": "So now I am happy, but not because my letter made you sad. No, I am happy because it made you turn away from wrong things. You became sad as God wanted you to be sad. So, when the letter made you sad, we did not really hurt you.",
    "verse_10": "People need to become sad in the way that God wants. When they are sad like that, it causes them to turn away from wrong things. Then God saves them from their sins. They will never be sorry about that! But when people become sad in the way that the world wants, it does not help them. They do not turn to God and they die in their spirits.",
    "verse_11": "You became sad in the way that God wanted. And see what good results that has brought! It has made you work hard to do good things. You want to show people that you do what is right. You are angry against sin. You want to obey God. You want to make things right again. You want to please God. You want to punish anyone who does wrong things. In all these ways, you have shown that you are right. You have done everything that was necessary in this matter.",
    "verse_12": "So why did I write that letter to you? It was not because of the person who did the wrong thing. Nor was it to help the person that he hurt. No. I wrote the letter to show you something about yourselves. I wanted God to show you that you do really love us and you respect us.",
    "verse_13": "That is how God has comforted us. It was not only us that God comforted. When Titus came, we were very happy to see how happy he was too. He was happy because all of you had taken care of him.",
    "verse_14": "I had told Titus that I was very proud of you. When he came to you, you showed that I was right about you. We have always spoken only true things to you. And when we said good things about you to Titus, you showed that those things were also true.",
    "verse_15": "Now, when Titus thinks about you, he loves you even more. He remembers that you were ready to obey him. You respected his authority and you received him into your homes.",
    "verse_16": "So now I am very happy because I trust you to do what is right."

  "chapter_8": {
    "verse_1": "My Christian friends, let me tell you about the believers in the churches in Macedonia. God has been very kind to them.",
    "verse_2": "They have had bad troubles, but they continued to be very happy. As a result, they gave a lot of money to other people. They themselves are very poor, but they still helped other people a lot.",
    "verse_3": "Let me tell you this. They gave as much money as they were able to give. Then they gave even more than that! They gave it because they wanted to.",
    "verse_4": "They wanted the chance to help God's people. That would make them happy. So they asked us many times to help them to do this.",
    "verse_5": "They did more than we had even hoped for! First, they gave themselves to the Lord. Then they also gave themselves to us. They did that because God wanted them to do it.",
    "verse_6": "Because of that, we asked Titus to continue to help you. He is the person who helped you to start giving money. So he will help you to finish this good work.",
    "verse_7": "You have so much of everything! You trust God very well. You speak well. You know everything. You want to do many good things. You love us even more than we love you! So also do the best that you can as you give money to help others.",
    "verse_8": "I am not telling you that you must do this. I have told you how much other believers want to give their money. In that way, I want to see if you really love other people who need your help.",
    "verse_9": "You know that our Lord Jesus Christ is very kind. He was rich, but he made himself poor to help you. So then, because he became poor, you could become rich.",
    "verse_10": "This is what I think you should do. Last year, you were the first people to give money. You really wanted to do that. So the best thing for you is to finish what you started to do.",
    "verse_11": "Now finish the work. When you started, you wanted very much to do it. Now you should want just as much to finish it. You should give what you are able to give.",
    "verse_12": "If you really want to give, then God will accept your gift. God does not want you to give more than you are able to give. He will be happy about what you can give.",
    "verse_13": "My purpose is not to bring trouble to you. You should not have pain while other people have plenty. Instead, both you and they should have enough.",
    "verse_14": "At this time, you yourselves have plenty. So you are able to give to those people who do not have enough. One day, things may change. They may have plenty, and you may not have enough. Then they can give money to help you. In that way, you will all have enough when you need it.",
    "verse_15": "It says this in the Bible: ‘The person who picked up a lot did not have too much. And the person who picked up a small amount also had enough.’",
    "verse_16": "Titus wants to help you just as much as we do. We thank God that he has made Titus ready to do that.",
    "verse_17": "He was very happy when we asked him to come to you. He himself already wanted to help you. So he really decided to visit you for himself.",
