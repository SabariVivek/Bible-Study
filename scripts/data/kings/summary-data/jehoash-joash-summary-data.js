        text: "King Jehoash, also known as Joash, was one of the kings of Judah, the southern kingdom. His story is told mainly in 2 Kings 11–12 and 2 Chronicles 22–24. He became king when he was only seven years old, and his life is one of the most interesting stories among the kings of Judah — a story that begins with great hope and ends with deep disappointment."

        heading: "Dark Times Under Queen Athaliah",
        text: "Before Joash became king, Judah was going through a very dark time. His grandmother, Queen Athaliah, who was the daughter of the wicked King Ahab and Queen Jezebel of Israel, had seized the throne after her son King Ahaziah (Joash’s father) was killed. To keep power, Athaliah tried to destroy the entire royal family so that no one from the line of David could become king. She wanted to wipe out all possible heirs and rule alone."

        heading: "God’s Promise and Joash’s Miraculous Survival",
        text: "But God’s promise to David could not be broken. In His mercy, He protected one small baby — Joash. When Athaliah was killing the royal children, Jehosheba, the sister of King Ahaziah and wife of the high priest Jehoiada, secretly took baby Joash and hid him in the Temple of the Lord. There, Joash was kept safe for six years, hidden from Athaliah’s eyes, while she ruled wickedly over the land."

        heading: "Joash Crowned King at Seven Years Old",
        text: "In the seventh year, the high priest Jehoiada decided that the time had come to restore the rightful heir to the throne. He gathered the temple guards, priests, Levites, and faithful men of Judah and revealed the hidden child to them. They made a plan to protect Joash and crown him king. On the appointed day, Jehoiada brought Joash out of hiding, placed a crown on his head, gave him the Book of the Law, and anointed him before the people. The crowd shouted joyfully, “Long live the king!”"

        heading: "The Fall of Queen Athaliah",
        text: "When Queen Athaliah heard the noise of the people rejoicing, she ran to the temple and saw the young boy standing by the pillar, wearing the crown. She screamed, “Treason! Treason!” But Jehoiada ordered the soldiers to take her away from the temple and kill her. In that moment, the wicked rule of Athaliah ended, and Joash, the true descendant of David, became king of Judah."

        heading: "Joash’s Early Faithfulness Under Jehoiada",
        text: "After Joash became king, Jehoiada helped him rule wisely and taught him to follow the ways of the Lord. As long as Jehoiada lived, Joash did what was right in the eyes of God. He respected the temple, encouraged worship, and wanted to honor the Lord."

    {
        heading: "Restoration of the Temple of the Lord",
        text: "One of the greatest things Joash did in the early years of his reign was to repair the Temple of the Lord, which had been damaged and neglected during Athaliah’s reign. The queen and her followers had taken many of the holy items from the temple and used them to worship Baal. Joash wanted to restore the temple to its original glory."

        heading: "Collecting Offerings and Repairing the Temple",
        text: "He ordered the priests and Levites to collect money from the people to repair the temple, but at first, the work was not done properly. Later, Joash and Jehoiada set up a large chest near the altar, where people could bring their offerings freely. The people responded generously, and soon, there was enough money to make all the repairs. The workers restored the temple, rebuilt damaged parts, and made new holy utensils for worship. The temple once again became a beautiful and sacred place."

        heading: "Peace and Blessing Under Jehoiada’s Leadership",
        text: "Under Jehoiada’s guidance, the nation turned back to God. The worship of Baal was removed, and peace returned to Judah. Joash’s early years were full of blessing because he listened to the advice of a godly priest."

        heading: "Joash Turns Away After Jehoiada’s Death",
        text: "However, after Jehoiada the priest died, everything began to change. Jehoiada had lived a long life — about 130 years — and had been like a father to Joash. But after his death, Joash started to listen to the wrong people. The officials of Judah came to flatter him, and soon Joash turned away from the Lord. He abandoned the temple that he had once repaired and began to serve idols, just like the kings of Israel."

        heading: "Prophets Warn Joash and Judah",
        text: "God, in His mercy, sent prophets to warn Joash and the people, urging them to return to Him, but they refused to listen. One of those prophets was Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada — the very priest who had saved Joash’s life and raised him. Zechariah stood before the people and said, “Why do you disobey the commands of the Lord? You will not prosper. Because you have forsaken the Lord, He has forsaken you.”"

    {
        heading: "Joash Orders the Death of Zechariah",
        text: "Instead of repenting, Joash became angry. Shockingly, he ordered that Zechariah be stoned to death in the courtyard of the temple — the very house of God that Joash had once loved. Zechariah’s last words were a cry for justice: “May the Lord see this and call you to account.”"

        heading: "God’s Judgment Through the Arameans",
        text: "After this terrible sin, God’s judgment came quickly upon Joash and his kingdom. The Arameans (Syrians) came to attack Judah with a small army, but the Lord allowed them to defeat Joash’s much larger army because Judah had forsaken Him. The enemy plundered Jerusalem and took away treasures, leaving the land weakened."

        heading: "Joash’s Death and Dishonor",
        text: "Joash was seriously wounded during the battle. While he was lying sick and helpless, some of his own servants conspired against him. They remembered how he had killed Zechariah, the son of Jehoiada, and decided to take revenge. They entered his bedchamber and killed him."

        heading: "Burial and Succession",
        text: "Joash was buried in the City of David, but not in the tombs of the kings. The people did not honor him as they had done for the faithful kings before him. His son Amaziah became the next king of Judah."

        heading: "Lessons from the Life of King Joash",
        text: "The story of King Joash is a powerful reminder that starting well is not enough — we must also finish well. Joash began his life under God’s protection and learned the right ways under a godly mentor, but when that guidance was gone, his heart drifted. He allowed pride and bad influence to lead him into sin and idolatry."

    {
        heading: "True Faith Must Be Personal",
        text: "From Joash’s life, we learn that true faith cannot depend on another person’s belief. We must have our own personal relationship with God. Jehoiada guided Joash in the right way, but when Joash stopped seeking God for himself, everything fell apart. His story teaches us that it is easy to lose the blessing of God when we forget His goodness and turn away from His truth."
