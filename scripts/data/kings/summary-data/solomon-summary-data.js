        text: "Solomon was the third king of Israel, the son of King David and Bathsheba. He was chosen by God to rule after his father David and is remembered as the wisest man who ever lived, the builder of the Temple of God in Jerusalem, and a king who brought great peace and prosperity to Israel. His story is found mainly in 1 Kings 1–11, 2 Chronicles 1–9, and parts of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon, which he wrote."

        heading: "Solomon Becomes King",
        text: "When David grew old, there was confusion about who would become the next king. David had many sons, and one of them, Adonijah, tried to make himself king without David’s permission. He gathered soldiers and important people to support him. But Bathsheba and Prophet Nathan went to David and reminded him that he had promised Solomon would rule after him. So David acted quickly. He had Solomon anointed as king by Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet at the Gihon spring. The people rejoiced loudly, and the sound of celebration made Adonijah’s supporters afraid. Adonijah’s plan failed, and Solomon firmly became the king."

        heading: "David’s Final Instructions",
        text: "Before David died, he gave Solomon important instructions. He told him to be strong, obey God’s commands, and walk faithfully as written in the Law of Moses. David also told Solomon to deal wisely with certain men who had caused trouble during his reign — such as Joab and Shimei. After giving these final words, King David died, having ruled Israel for forty years."

        heading: "Early Reign and Security",
        text: "Solomon’s reign began with peace and stability. He first secured his throne by dealing with threats. Adonijah, though forgiven once, later asked to marry Abishag, the young woman who had cared for David in his old age. Solomon saw this as another attempt to claim the throne and ordered Adonijah to be executed. Joab, who had sided with Adonijah, was also killed, and Shimei, who had cursed David, was put to death after breaking an oath. Once these matters were settled, Solomon’s kingdom was established firmly."

        heading: "Solomon’s Request for Wisdom",
        text: "One night, God appeared to Solomon in a dream at Gibeon, where Solomon had offered a thousand burnt offerings. God said, “Ask for whatever you want me to give you.” Solomon could have asked for riches, long life, or victory over enemies, but instead, he said, “Lord, you have made me king over a great people. I am only a child and do not know how to lead them. Give me wisdom and understanding to govern your people well.”"

    {
        heading: "God Blesses Solomon",
        text: "God was pleased with this request. He said, “Because you have asked for wisdom and not for wealth or long life, I will give you both wisdom and all the things you did not ask for — riches and honor.” From that day, Solomon became known for his great wisdom, unlike anyone before or after him."

    {
        heading: "Solomon’s Famous Judgment",
        text: "Not long after, Solomon’s wisdom was clearly shown. Two women came to him with a difficult case. They lived in the same house and both had given birth to babies. One baby had died, and each woman claimed that the living baby was hers. Solomon asked for a sword and said, “Cut the living child in two and give half to each woman.” The real mother immediately cried out, “Please, my lord, give her the baby — do not kill him!” But the other woman said, “Neither I nor you shall have him. Cut him in two!” Then Solomon said, “Give the baby to the first woman; she is the real mother.” All Israel heard of this judgment and saw that the wisdom of God was in Solomon."

    {
        heading: "Organization of the Kingdom",
        text: "Solomon organized his kingdom with great care. He appointed twelve governors over Israel to collect supplies and provide food for the royal household. Under his rule, Israel became very rich and peaceful. The Bible says that during Solomon’s reign, everyone lived safely, “each man under his own vine and fig tree.” Silver was as common as stones in Jerusalem."

        heading: "Alliances and Trade",
        text: "Solomon made alliances with other nations. He married Pharaoh’s daughter of Egypt and formed strong trade partnerships with neighboring kingdoms. His fame spread to all nations. Kings and rulers sent gifts and came to hear his wisdom."

    {
        heading: "Building the Temple of God",
        text: "One of Solomon’s greatest achievements was the building of the Temple of God in Jerusalem — a task his father David had long desired but was not allowed to complete. Solomon began the project in the fourth year of his reign. He made a treaty with Hiram, king of Tyre, who supplied cedar wood from Lebanon and skilled craftsmen. Thousands of workers were employed — Israelites and foreigners — to cut stones, carry materials, and build the temple."

    {
        heading: "The Temple’s Magnificence",
        text: "The Temple of the Lord was a magnificent structure. It took seven years to complete. The inside was lined with pure gold, and fine decorations of cherubim, palm trees, and flowers covered the walls. The Ark of the Covenant was placed in the Most Holy Place, and when the priests brought it in, a cloud filled the temple, showing that God’s presence had come to dwell there."

    {
        heading: "Dedication of the Temple",
        text: "During the dedication of the temple, Solomon stood before the altar, lifted his hands toward heaven, and prayed a long and heartfelt prayer. He praised God for keeping His promise to David and asked that God would hear the prayers of anyone who came to the temple, whether Israelite or foreigner. He prayed for forgiveness, mercy, and guidance for the nation. After the prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the sacrifices, and the people bowed down and worshiped God, saying, “He is good; His mercy endures forever.”"

        heading: "Solomon’s Palace and Trade",
        text: "Solomon also built a grand palace for himself, which took thirteen years to complete, and many other buildings throughout his kingdom. He developed trade routes, imported gold from Ophir, and built a fleet of ships at Ezion-Geber. Every year, vast quantities of gold, silver, spices, and precious stones came into Jerusalem. Solomon even made a great throne of ivory covered with gold, with twelve lion statues on its steps."

        heading: "The Queen of Sheba Visits",
        text: "He became so rich and wise that rulers from distant lands came to see him. One of the most famous visitors was the Queen of Sheba. She came with a caravan of camels carrying spices, gold, and precious stones to test Solomon with difficult questions. Solomon answered everything she asked. When she saw his wisdom, the temple he had built, his palace, his servants, and the offerings in the temple, she was amazed. She said, “The report I heard in my own country was true, but I did not believe it until I came and saw it with my own eyes. Indeed, not even half was told me.” She blessed the Lord for giving Israel such a wise king."

        heading: "Solomon’s Later Disobedience",
        text: "For many years, Solomon ruled with justice and peace. However, as time went on, his heart began to turn away from God. He loved many foreign women — from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and Egypt — and he married many wives, around seven hundred wives and three hundred concubines. These women brought their own gods and idols with them, and Solomon began to build altars for their idols to please them."

    {
        heading: "God’s Judgment on Solomon",
        text: "This disobedience greatly displeased God. The Lord had appeared to Solomon twice and had clearly told him not to follow other gods. But Solomon’s heart was divided. He worshiped idols like Ashtoreth and Molech along with the true God."

    {
        heading: "Enemies Raised Against Solomon",
        text: "God became angry and said, “Since you have not kept my covenant, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants. Yet for the sake of David your father, I will not do it in your lifetime. Your son will lose most of the kingdom.” From that time, God raised up enemies against Solomon — such as Hadad the Edomite, Rezon of Damascus, and Jeroboam, one of Solomon’s own officials, who would later lead the northern tribes of Israel."

    {
        heading: "Death and Legacy",
        text: "After reigning for forty years, Solomon died and was buried in the City of David. His son Rehoboam became king after him. Solomon’s life was one of great wisdom, wealth, and accomplishment, yet it also warns that wisdom without obedience leads to downfall. He began with a humble heart that sought God but ended with a heart distracted by pride and pleasure. Still, Solomon left behind a great spiritual legacy — the Temple of God, and the books of Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon, which teach wisdom, the meaning of life, and the beauty of love."
