        heading: "King Jeroboam II – The Prosperous King Who Forgot God",
        text: "King Jeroboam II was one of the kings of the northern kingdom of Israel, and he ruled many years after the first Jeroboam, who had led Israel into idolatry. His story is told in 2 Kings 14:23–29 and mentioned in the books of the prophets Amos and Hosea. Jeroboam II was the son of King Jehoash (Joash) and reigned for forty-one years in Samaria. He became king during the reign of Amaziah, king of Judah."

        heading: "A Time of Outward Success and Hidden Corruption",
        text: "Jeroboam II’s time was a period of great outward success for Israel. The nation became very strong and wealthy, its borders expanded, and people lived in comfort and luxury. But beneath this success, there was great spiritual corruption, injustice, and pride. Though God blessed Israel with prosperity during his reign, the people’s hearts remained far from Him."

        heading: "God’s Mercy Despite Evil Leadership",
        text: "When Jeroboam II came to the throne, Israel had been weakened by wars and enemy attacks in earlier years. But God, in His mercy, chose to lift Israel up again for a time. The Bible says that Jeroboam “did what was evil in the sight of the Lord.” Like the first Jeroboam, he continued in idol worship and led the people to sin. He allowed golden calves to remain in Bethel and Dan, where people wrongly worshiped instead of going to Jerusalem as God had commanded."

        heading: "Prophecy of Jonah and Israel’s Restoration",
        text: "Even though Jeroboam did not follow the Lord faithfully, God still used him to help Israel. Through the prophet Jonah, son of Amittai, who came from Gath-hepher (the same prophet who later went to Nineveh), God gave a message that Israel’s borders would be restored. According to Jonah’s prophecy, Jeroboam II was to recover lost territories of Israel from Lebo Hamath in the north down to the Dead Sea in the south."

        heading: "Jeroboam’s Military Success and National Prosperity",
        text: "Jeroboam obeyed this military direction and successfully restored these lands. He brought back the territories that earlier kings had lost to the Arameans (Syrians) and others. His victories gave Israel a strong position and great wealth once again. The people enjoyed peace and prosperity, and the kingdom reached almost the same size it had been in the days of Solomon."

        heading: "Prophets Amos and Hosea Warn Against Sin",
        text: "However, during this time of national success, the hearts of the people became proud and self-centered. They thought that their prosperity meant God was pleased with them, but that was not true. The prophets Amos and Hosea, who lived during Jeroboam II’s reign, spoke strongly against the sins of the people."

    {
        heading: "Amos Condemns Injustice and Hypocrisy",
        text: "Prophet Amos warned that Israel was living in luxury while ignoring justice and righteousness. The rich were oppressing the poor, the judges were taking bribes, and worship had become empty and hypocritical. People went to the temples at Bethel and Gilgal to make offerings, but their hearts were full of greed and idolatry. Amos declared that God was about to bring judgment on Israel for their sins unless they repented."
    },
    {
        heading: "Hosea’s Message of Warning and Love",
        text: "Prophet Hosea also spoke during this time. He described Israel as an unfaithful wife who had turned away from her husband, God, to follow other lovers — the idols and sinful pleasures of the world. Hosea’s messages were full of both warning and love. God still cared deeply for His people, but He wanted them to return to Him with all their hearts."

    {
        heading: "Jeroboam and the People Refuse to Repent",
        text: "Despite these warnings, Jeroboam II and his people did not repent. They continued to live proudly, thinking that their power and success would last forever. They forgot that it was God who had given them victory and wealth."
    },
    {
        heading: "God’s Compassion and Israel’s Misused Blessing",
        text: "In His mercy, God had allowed Jeroboam to bring stability to Israel because He “saw that the affliction of Israel was very bitter.” There was no one left to help them, and yet God did not want to destroy them completely. So He used Jeroboam II to bring temporary relief and prosperity. But the people misused this blessing. Instead of being thankful and turning back to God, they grew more comfortable in sin."

    {
        heading: "The Collapse After Jeroboam’s Death",
        text: "After Jeroboam II died, his kingdom began to collapse quickly. His son Zechariah ruled only for a short time before being assassinated, and within a few decades, Israel was destroyed completely by the Assyrians. The wealth and peace that Jeroboam had built disappeared because the people had built their lives on disobedience instead of faithfulness to God."

    {
        heading: "Lessons from Jeroboam II’s Reign",
        text: "Jeroboam II’s reign shows us that material success does not mean spiritual success. A nation or a person may appear strong and prosperous, but if they turn from God, their fall is only a matter of time. God had blessed Israel not because of Jeroboam’s goodness, but because of His mercy. But when mercy is ignored and people keep sinning, judgment will surely come."
    },
    {
        heading: "The Final Warning from Jeroboam II’s Story",
        text: "King Jeroboam II’s story is a reminder that God’s patience has a purpose. He gives people time to repent and return to Him. But if they refuse to listen, even great strength and riches cannot save them. Under Jeroboam II, Israel reached its highest level of prosperity, but spiritually it was at its lowest point. Soon after his death, the kingdom of Israel began to crumble — and within a few generations, it would be gone forever."
